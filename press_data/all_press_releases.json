World-leading expert, Dr. Alexander Rotenberg will join company management to discuss the emerging use of a wide range of biomarkers for the study of anti-seizure medicines. The event will take place at Ovid’s headquarters in New York’s Hudson Yards from 9:30 to 10:30 am ET and will be webcast simultaneously.\nSophisticated imaging and radiological tools are increasingly enabling medicines developers to leverage biomarkers earlier in clinical development to identify signals of biological target engagement and pharmacodynamic activity. Discussion will focus on how these tools drive evidence informed approaches in drug development and provide insight into potential clinical outcomes. Ovid management will describe the exploratory biomarkers in use to measure its next-generation GABA-aminotransferase (GABA-AT) inhibitor program, OV329, which is anticipated to have a topline readout in Q3 2025.\nKeynote speaker:\nLeading pediatric neurologist and epileptologist Alexander Rotenberg, M.D., Ph.D.\nProfessor of Neurology at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and Director of the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at Boston Children’s Hospital, and the Experimental Neurophysiology Core at F.M. Kirby Center of Neurobiology\nUnfortunately, nearly 40 percent of people living with epilepsy continue to experience seizures despite existing medicines. OV329 is a next-generation GABA-AT inhibitor, that was rationally designed to work differently from current medicines and may offer a novel approach for patients with treatment-resistant seizures. OV329 seeks to endogenously deliver optimal levels of GABA to reduce seizures and provide a preferable safety and tolerability profile relative to the first-generation, GABA-AT inhibitor, vigabatrin. OV329 is currently completing a Phase 1 study that is evaluating its effects on multiple pharmacodynamic biomarkers, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics.\nInterested in attending or participating remotely:\nTo register, please visit:\nRegistration Link\nA live webcast of the presentation can be accessed through the Events & Presentations section of Ovid's website at\nhttps://investors.ovidrx.com\n.\nAbout Ovid Therapeutics\nOvid Therapeutics Inc. is a New York-based biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing small molecule medicines for brain conditions with significant unmet need.

(Nasdaq: OVID), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing small molecule medicines for brain conditions with significant unmet need, today reported business updates and financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025.\n“We’re off to a strong start across our pipeline and programs in what will be a defining year for Ovid,” said Dr. Jeremy Levin, D.Phil., MB BChir., Chairman and CEO of Ovid Therapeutics. “Our lead program, OV329, continues to show promise as a potential next-generation medicine for treatment resistant seizures, and we are on track to share key safety and biomarker data later this year. We’ve also initiated human trials of our first-in-class KCC2 direct activator—a long-sought biological target in central nervous system drug development because it is considered to be a “master switch” on neural hyperexcitability. We are excited for these readouts and anticipate that OV4071, our first oral KCC2 direct activator, will be submitted to initiate clinical development by year end.”\nCLINICAL PIPELINE\nOvid’s clinical pipeline of potential first-in-class and best-in-class small molecule programs is advancing in line with previously stated guidance. The programs are intended to restore neural excitatory:inhibitory balance and provide preferable tolerability and safety profiles. Active clinical-stage programs include: OV329, a potential best-in-class, next-generation GABA aminotransferase (GABA-AT) inhibitor, and OV350, the first-ever direct activator of the potassium chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2). Both programs have broad applications across a number of neurological and neuropsychiatric indications in which excess neural excitation is implicated.\nOV329, a next-generation GABA-AT inhibitor, is anticipated to readout topline results in Q3 2025.\nOvid is developing OV329 for the potential treatment of drug-resistant epilepsies (DREs). OV329 was rationally designed to endogenously deliver optimal levels of GABA to reduce seizures and provide a preferable safety and tolerability profile relative to vigabatrin, a first-generation GABA-AT inhibitor. Ovid’s preclinical characterization suggests OV329 is 100- to 1,000-fold more potent than vigabatrin in animals, delivers synaptic and extrasynaptic inhibition, and has a therapeutic index without appearing to induce sedation at therapeutic doses.\nStatus\nOvid is actively conducting a high-dose SAD/MAD cohort in its ongoing Phase 1 trial of healthy volunteers with the goal of optimizing multiple dosing opportunities for future Phase 2 programs. Pharmacodynamic (PD), target engagement, pharmacokinetic (PK), safety and tolerability results are expected in late Q3 2025.\nBiomarker strategy\nThe Phase 1 trial applies biomarkers designed to measure OV329’s potential clinical effect and target engagement at various doses. These biomarker parameters are well-established measures for anti-seizure medicines and can demonstrate PD activity in healthy volunteers. Key biomarkers being evaluated leverage:\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure potential cortical inhibition and GABAergic (inhibitory) activity.\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to evaluate if levels of GABA increase in the medial parietal lobe.\nQuantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) to assess changes to frequency bands associated with GABAergic activity.\nSafety\nIn cohorts completed to date, there have been no reported serious adverse events associated with OV329.\nIndication strategy\nPending the outcomes of the Phase 1 trial, Ovid intends to take up to two doses into an adaptive Phase 2a trial design in adults with treatment resistant focal seizures. Ovid believes this approach will provide the Company with maximal opportunities to pursue multiple indications for future clinical studies, such as adult drug resistant epilepsies (DREs) or pediatric and adult patients with select developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs).\nOV350, a KCC2 direct activator, is being studied in a Phase 1 trial.\nIn March 2025, Ovid initiated dosing of healthy volunteers with an intravenous formulation of OV350. The Phase 1 SAD/MAD study is intended to potentially demonstrate safety, tolerability and PK parameters. Ovid intends to leverage PD/PK findings from OV350 to inform its oral KCC2 program, OV4071.\nIn preclinical and animal disease models, OV350 has demonstrated antipsychotic and anticonvulsant effects, suggesting that directly activating the cotransporter may offer broad therapeutic utility.\nPRECLINICAL PIPELINE\nOral candidates from KCC2 direct activator library advancing in IND-enabling studies\n. Ovid is conducting IND-enabling and formulation efforts for three unique KCC2 direct activator molecules from its larger library. These programs represent oral and subcutaneous formulations and are expected to yield successive regulatory submissions to initiate clinical development annually for the next three to four years. Ovid’s programs have discreet structures and may have therapeutic relevance across a range of conditions with symptoms driven by neural hyperexcitability, such as seizures and psychoses.\nOV4071 is an oral KCC2 direct activator on-track to initiate a proof-of-concept study in H1 2026.\nOV4071 is a potent, oral direct activator that has demonstrated strong anti-psychosis activity in animal studies. The initial indication intended for OV4071 is psychosis associated with neuronal-synuclein diseases (NSD), including Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia (LBD). These conditions share a common underlying biology, have an established regulatory pathway and clinical development paradigm, and represent areas of substantial unmet need.\nBUSINESS STRATEGY & UPDATES\nOvid expects its cash runway to support operations and clinical development programs into the 2H of 2026, during which time multiple pipeline and regulatory milestones are anticipated.\nThese anticipated milestones include: results for OV329 PD biomarker and safety data (Q3 2025); initiation of a Phase 2a patient study for OV329 in drug resistant epilepsies (Q1 2026); results from the Phase 1 SAD/MAD study with OV350, the Company's first KCC2 direct activator (Q4 2025); and initiation of a proof-of-concept trial for the first oral KCC2 direct activator, OV4071 (Q2 2026).\nGiven the breadth and depth of its pipeline, and the broad therapeutic opportunity it may yield, the Company will continue to explore a range of options to accelerate development and offset costs, such as partnerships, co-development and regional opportunities for select programs; as well as monetizing equity positions, IP and non-CNS applications of its candidates. The Company will continue to manage its clinical development programs, operations, and cash expenditures with fiscal discipline to support the potential achievement of key value-creating clinical milestones.\nFirst Quarter 2025 financial results\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, 2025 totaled $43.0 million.\nRevenues from royalty agreements were $130,000 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, as compared to $148,000 in the same period in 2024.\nResearch and development expenses were $6.7 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, compared to $10.4 million in the same period in 2024. The decrease is related to the organizational restructuring in Q2 2024 to reprioritize Ovid’s clinical and preclinical pipeline programs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $6.0 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, as compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease was driven by the organizational restructuring and related cost-reduction efforts.\nTotal operating expenses were $12.7 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, as compared to $17.6 million for the same period last year.\nOvid reported a net loss of $10.2 million, or basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.14, for the first quarter of 2025, as compared to a net loss of $11.7 million, or basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.17, for the same period in 2024.\nAbout Ovid Therapeutics\nOvid Therapeutics Inc. is a New York-based biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing small molecule medicines for brain conditions with significant unmet need.

(Nasdaq: OVID), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing small molecule medicines for brain conditions with significant unmet need, today reported business updates and financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024.\n“Ovid is at an exciting inflection point. Our pipeline programs are moving into the next stage of clinical development and I believe our team is the strongest that it has been since the founding of the Company,” said Dr. Jeremy Levin, D.Phil., MB BChir., Chairman and CEO of Ovid Therapeutics. “To support us in capturing the substantial potential therapeutic and financial value associated with OV329, our program for treatment-resistant epilepsies, and our portfolio of first-in-class KCC2 activators, Dr. Stelios Papadopoulos has joined our Board and two industry leaders, Dr. Manal Morsy and Victoria “Tori” Fort joined our management team. Stelios’s extensive industry expertise and strategic vision will be invaluable to Ovid through our next stage of growth. Manal and Tori will support our regulatory and investor strategy and engagement,” stated Levin.\nBusiness Strategy & Updates\nOvid expects its cash runway to support operations and clinical development programs into the second half of 2026, during which time multiple pipeline and regulatory milestones are anticipated. These anticipated milestones include: results for OV329 biomarker and safety data (Q3 2025); initiation of a Phase 2a patient study for OV329 in drug resistant epilepsies (Q1 2026); results from a first-in-human safety and exploratory biomarker study with OV350, our first KCC2 direct activator (Q4 2025); and initiation of human trials for the first oral KCC2 direct activator, OV4071 (Q2 2026). In the event the Company is unable to raise capital or enter into partnerships or co-development opportunities as and when needed, it will be required to delay, reduce the scope of or prioritize various research and development activities.\nThe Company will continue to manage its clinical development programs, operations and cash expenditures with fiscal discipline to support the potential achievement of key value-creating clinical milestones. Given the breadth and depth of its pipeline, and the broad therapeutic opportunity it may yield, Ovid will continue to explore partnerships and co-development opportunities for select programs and regions to accelerate development and offset costs. Additional pipeline updates follow below.\nOrganizational Updates\nOvid has strengthened its Board of Directors and leadership team with key appointments intended to support the Company’s pipeline, business development and financial strategies. These include:\nAppointed Stelios Papadopolous, Ph.D., to serve on Board of Directors.\nDr. Papadopolous is a scientist, investor and entrepreneur who has played a pivotal role in shaping the biotechnology industry for the last 30 years through bridging scientific discovery with financial strategy. His leadership, deal-making creativity, and ability to catalyze growth will be instrumental to Ovid as it seeks to capture the full potential value of its pipeline programs. Dr. Papadopoulos has served in roles including: the Vice Chairman of Cowen & Co., LLC; a leader in investment banking at PaineWebber, Chairman of PaineWebber Development Corp., a subsidiary focusing on biotechnology; and Vice President in the Equity Research Department of Drexel Burnham Lambert, covering the biotechnology industry. Dr. Papadopolous will serve on the Audit and Compensation Committees of Ovid’s Board of Directors.\nLeadership appointments.\nIn February 2025, Manal Morsy, M.D., Ph.D., MBA and Victoria Fort joined Ovid as Chief Regulatory Officer and Head of Corporate Affairs & Corporate Strategy, respectively. Dr. Morsy brings deep expertise from successful global regulatory strategies and submissions spanning three decades, including adult and pediatric development drug candidates at J&J, Merck, PTC, and Athersys. She is a trained scientist, clinician and geneticist whose work has been published in many leading scientific and medical journals. Ms. Fort joins Ovid from Frontier Medicines, where she led corporate strategy, guided the company’s transition to a clinical-stage organization and helped secure critical financing.\nPipeline Strategy & Updates\nOvid is advancing a differentiated pipeline of potential first-in-class and best-in-class small molecule medicines that are intended to bring hyperexcited neurons back to homeostasis. The Company seeks to become a leader in neurotherapeutics by addressing intractable brain disorders with significant unmet need. This includes treating conditions and symptoms that manifest from excessive neural excitation such as seizures and psychosis.\nCentral to the Company’s strategy is identifying and developing differentiated mechanisms of action to interdict unaddressed biological targets in the central nervous system (CNS) that are fundamental to disease pathology. This strategy includes developing a potential best-in-class, next-generation GABA aminotransferase (GABA-AT) inhibitor; translating the direct activation of the potassium chloride co-transporter 2 (KCC2) for a broad range of neurological and psychiatric conditions; and pioneering Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) inhibition for neurovascular and neuro-inflammatory conditions.\nOV329\nA next-generation GABA-AT inhibitor:\nOvid is developing OV329 as a next-generation GABA-AT inhibitor for the potential treatment of drug-resistant epilepsies (DREs) in adult and pediatric patients. OV329 seeks to endogenously deliver optimal levels of GABA to reduce seizures and provide a preferable safety and tolerability profile relative to the first-generation, GABA-AT inhibitor, vigabatrin. Ovid’s preclinical characterization suggests that OV329 is 100-fold more potent than vigabatrin in animals, delivers synaptic and extra-synaptic inhibition, and has a lasting pharmacodynamic effect despite rapid tissue clearance. In animal models, OV329 has been shown to have a therapeutic index and does not appear to induce sedation at therapeutic doses, whereas vigabatrin has no therapeutic window. A therapeutic dose of vigabatrin has been shown by independent researchers, and by Ovid, to preferentially accumulate in the retina.\nHuman safety & tolerability:\nOvid is completing a Phase 1 single- ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study evaluating OV329’s safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and biomarkers that may serve as a measure of clinical effect and target engagement. In the cohorts completed to-date, there have been no serious adverse events and no adverse events reported have been associated with OV329.\nTopline biomarker & safety data expected Q3 2025:\nOvid added a higher dose cohort to its Phase 1 study, to increase dosing opportunities for future Phase 2 programs. Topline results from this cohort is expected in Q3 2025, and will include findings regarding how OV329 performed in specific parameters of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Collectively, Ovid believes TMS and MRS have the potential to detect GABAergic activity, target engagement and clinical effect.\nTMS is a proven protocol for focal non-invasive electrical cortical stimulation that can safely and non-invasively measure target engagement. TMS has been previously used to correlate anti-seizure activity with vigabatrin and other anti-seizure medications (“ASMs”). Ovid is utilizing a range of TMS parameters for OV329, which can measure cortical excitation, including GABA-ergic, GABA (A) and GABA (B) receptor activity\n1\n.\nMRS technology has been utilized with other ASMs, including vigabatrin, as a way to measure GABA levels in selected regions of the brain. Utilizing MRS, Ovid will be able to evaluate and quantify the change in GABA levels in the medial parietal lobe relative to an untreated baseline.\nOcular safety profile:\nTo evaluate OV329’s safety compared to vigabatrin, Ovid has conducted additional animal experiments to evaluate the risk of drug accumulating in the eye and causing retinal cell dysregulation. At the 2024 American Epilepsy Society meeting in December, Ovid presented the full results from an animal study, which demonstrated that OV329 did not accumulate in animal eyes, in contrast to vigabatrin, which was found to accumulate in less than 48 hours. OV329 was present in the brain and plasma of mice, then rapidly cleared the tissue and remained undetectable in the retina, eye, and brain. In contrast, vigabatrin was demonstrated to preferentially accumulate in the eye, retina and brain, which is consistent with previously published independent research.\nOV350 and KCC2 library\nInitiated a Phase 1, first-in-human study for a KCC2 direct activator, OV350:\nIn Q4 2024, Ovid successfully submitted a regulatory application for a Phase 1 trial of OV350 and initiated a first-in-human study for this class of molecule in Q1 2025. OV350 is the first of multiple anticipated programs from Ovid’s library of KCC2 direct activators. The Phase 1 trial intends to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters of an intravenous formulation of OV350 in healthy human volunteers. It will also include an exploratory biomarker using quantitative EEG. In preclinical and animal disease models, OV350 has demonstrated antipsychotic and anticonvulsant effects, indicating that it may have broad therapeutic utility. The initial indication intended for OV350, and the oral program to follow, is psychosis associated with neuronal-synuclein diseases (NSD), including Parkinson’s disease, and Lewy body dementia (LBD). These conditions have similar underlying biology, significant unmet need and an established regulatory pathway.\nKCC2 direct activator library.\nOvid has made significant progress with its KCC2 direct activator library and is progressing four programs toward clinical development, which are expected to yield successive regulatory submissions annually for the next three to four years. These programs are unique structures with discreet pharmacology and differentiated therapeutic attributes as characterized in phenotypic and disease biology models. Ovid believes these molecules may have relevance across a range of conditions that have symptoms driven by neural hyperexcitability such as seizures and psychoses. Based upon the bioavailability and potency characteristics, Ovid believes different programs in the library have amenability for oral and intramuscular or subcutaneous formulations to address clinical indications across the care continuum.\nOV4071, the first oral KCC2 direct activator:\nOvid has initiated IND-enabling studies of OV4071, the first oral direct activator of the biological target, KCC2. It anticipates initiating human studies with OV4071 in Q2 2026, with both healthy volunteer and patient cohorts. This oral program behaves similarly to OV350 in phenotypic and disease model screens and is similarly intended for the potential treatment of psychoses in NSD and LBD.\nOV888/GV101 & ROCK2 inhibitor programs\nOV888/GV101 Capsule for CCM:\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Ovid and Graviton Bioscience announced the decision to pause the initiation of the Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of OV888/ GV101 capsule, following the recent completion of long-duration competitor and academic trials in CCM, and after discussions with key stakeholders. Ovid and Graviton Bioscience are evaluating clinical design learnings and regulatory feedback from recently completed competitor Phase 2 programs. Ovid and Graviton Bioscience are confident of the potential therapeutic effects of ROCK2 inhibition for CCM and will seek to optimize future development approaches with the benefit of further insights on study duration, enrichment strategies, endpoints, and time-to-event measurements.\nFourth\nQuarter and Annual\n2024\nF\ninancial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024 totaled $53.1 million.\nRevenues from royalty agreements were $566,000 for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $392,000 for the same period in 2023.\nResearch and development expenses were $5.9 million and $36.8 million for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $10.6 million and $28.6 million for the same periods in 2023. The overall increase is related to the advancement of Ovid’s clinical and preclinical pipeline programs as described above. The decrease between the three-month periods is the result of the organizational restructuring in the second quarter of 2024, which re-prioritized development programs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.9 million and $25.7 million for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $7.7 million and $31.1 million for the same periods in 2023. The decrease was driven by the previous organizational restructuring and related cost-reduction efforts.\nTotal operating expenses were $10.8 million and $62.5 million for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $18.3 million and $59.7 million for the same periods in 2023.\nOvid reported a net loss of $9.3 million, or basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.13 for the three months ended December 31, 2024, as compared to a net loss of $15.3 million, or basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.21 for the same period in 2023. Ovid reported a net loss of $26.4 million, or basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.37 for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to a net loss of $52.3 million, or basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.73 for the same period in 2023.\n1\nTsuboyama M, Lee Kaye H, Rotenberg A.

(NASDAQ: PRAX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating genetic insights into the development of therapies for central nervous system (CNS) disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted BTD for relutrigine, a sodium channel functional state modulator for pediatric use for the treatment of patients with SCN2A and SCN8A DEEs.\n“This BTD represents a significant milestone for our relutrigine program and further validates its potential. The EMBOLD cohort 1 study supporting our application enrolled the most severe DEE population ever studied and included patients that failed three treatments on average before joining the study. The results from the open-label extension are remarkable, showing an average of both approximately 90% reduction in seizures and over two months between seizures. These extremely encouraging clinical results translate to tangible improvement in quality of life for patients and their caregivers. We continue to execute on the registrational EMBOLD cohort 2 study and expect to share the topline results no later than the first half of 2026. We are excited that this BTD, in addition to the Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in SCN2A and SCN8A DEEs, further supports expedited development of relutrigine,” commented Marcio Souza, president and chief executive officer. “In addition to this exciting update for the SCN2A and SCN8A population, we are looking forward to results from the EMERALD study which has recently been initiated for DEE patients, regardless of etiology.”\nThe BTD enables expedited development and regulatory review for drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that relutrigine may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over existing therapies. The BTD for relutrigine was supported by the positive data from cohort 1 in the Phase 2 EMBOLD study, as well as 11-month data from the open-label extension (OLE) period of the trial. Data from the double-blind period (16 weeks of treatment) showed a placebo-adjusted monthly motor seizure reduction of 46% during the double-blind period and seizure freedom in over 30% of patients while on relutrigine. Additionally, meaningful gains were observed in alertness, communication and seizure severity as noted by both clinicians and caregivers. In May 2025, Praxis provided a data update from the ongoing OLE part of the trial during a\nvirtual investor event\n. At month 11, an average of approximately 90% seizure reduction was observed in patients, and a sustained and continuous improvement in seizure-free periods was observed, with a mean of 67 days without seizures compared to 3 days in the baseline period. There were no new safety signals, drug related serious adverse events or dose reductions needed.\nThe EMBOLD registrational cohort 2 is currently ongoing and continues to enroll, with topline results expected no later than the first half of 2026, followed by a potential NDA filing.\nPraxis has recently initiated the EMERALD study evaluating relutrigine in patients across all DEEs. EMERALD is a registrational, 16-week, placebo-controlled study evaluating seizure reduction in patients diagnosed with developmental epilepsies.\nAbout Relutrigine (PRAX-562)\nRelutrigine is a first-in-class small molecule in development for the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) as a preferential inhibitor of persistent sodium current, shown to be a key driver of seizure symptoms in severe DEEs. Relutrigine’s mechanism of precision sodium channel (NaV) modulation is consistent with superior selectivity for disease-state NaV channel hyperexcitability. In vivo studies of relutrigine have demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of seizures up to complete control of seizure activity in SCN2A, SCN8A and other DEE mouse models. Relutrigine has been generally well-tolerated in three Phase 1 studies and has demonstrated biomarker changes indicative of NaV channel modulation. Data from cohort 1 of the Phase 2 EMBOLD study demonstrated a well-tolerated, robust, short- and long-term improvement in motor seizures in a heavily pre-treated population alongside maintained seizure freedom in some patients with SCN2A- and SCN8A-DEE. Relutrigine has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE, SCN8A-DEE and Dravet syndrome, as well as Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD), and ODD from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE and SCN8A-DEE. To learn more about the EMERALD and EMBOLD studies, please visit\nResilienceStudies.com\n.\nAbout Praxis\nPraxis Precision Medicines is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating insights from genetic epilepsies into the development of therapies for CNS disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance.

(NASDAQ: PRAX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating genetic insights into the development of therapies for central nervous system (CNS) disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance, hosted a virtual investor event on its clinical programs in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) on Friday, May 2, 2025.\n“We were excited to highlight the significant opportunity in DEEs and progress Praxis is making in this field,” said Marcio Souza, president and chief executive officer of Praxis. “Relutrigine continues to show tremendous promise to broadly address the DEE market opportunity, supported by robust pre-clinical results in multiple DEE models and further strengthened by new data from the EMBOLD study showing increasing seizure control over time. We also presented the EMBRAVE3 design for elsunersen in SCN2A gain-of-function (GoF) patients. This is not only the shortest known trial for an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) but also supports a potential regulatory pathway for early intervention with treatment starting at birth when symptoms of this devastating disease first appear. We are also thrilled to see great progress in our ASO portfolio, with PRAX-100 in mono-genetic autism on track to declare a development candidate by mid-year. This is truly an exciting period for the DEE community and Praxis, and we look forward to continue sharing our progress with multiple upcoming catalysts.”\nThe slide presentation and a replay of the event are available on Praxis’ website on the “\nEvents and Presentations\n” page under the investor section.\nKey Event Topics and Highlights:\nRelutrigine\nPraxis shared updated data from the initial cohort of patients in the EMBOLD study, highlighting results through 11 months of patient dosing. The open-label extension (OLE) includes 12 patients who continued on relutrigine following completion of the initial four-month double-blind period:\nPatients achieved a mean seizure reduction of approximately 90% from baseline.\nThe mean longest period without seizures for patients is 67 days after 11 months of exposure, compared to 3 days at baseline. The EMBOLD registrational study for SCN2A and SCN8A-DEEs continues to enroll strongly with topline results expected no later than the first half of 2026.\nPraxis presented a comprehensive set of pre-clinical data spanning 10 different DEE disease models, providing compelling evidence that relutrigine’s anti-seizure mechanism is well suited for broad DEEs. Praxis plans to initiate the EMERALD registrational study in mid-2025.\nEMERALD will recruit 160 patients in a randomized, placebo-controlled study with a 16-week treatment period to evaluate seizure reduction.\nPatients will be selected based on clinical phenotype, irrespective of genetic etiology.\nWith a target population exceeding 200,000 patients in the US and precedent from other approved DEE therapies, Praxis conservatively estimates a US market potential of at least $3 billion.\nThe company also shared its expectation that relutrigine could potentially be used in combination with any of its DEE ASO programs (elsunersen, PRAX-080, PRAX-090) allowing patients to receive both therapies together for broader clinical benefit.\nElsunersen\nEMBRAVE Part A is enrolling up to 16 patients on a 3:1 drug to sham ratio with once-monthly intrathecal dosing for six months. Recruitment is expected to be complete by mid-year with topline results in the first half of 2026.\nThe EMBRAVE3 registrational trial, initiating in mid-2025, will initially enroll patients ages 2-18. Subsequent cohorts will support treatment initiation from birth, reflecting the early onset of SCN2A GoF DEE which can present in-utero or shortly after birth and is often diagnosed within the first three weeks of life.\nWith a global addressable population estimated at 5,000 patients, and pricing analogs for other approved ASOs, Praxis conservatively estimates a global market potential of $1 billion.\nSolidus pre-clinical pipeline\nPraxis plans to nominate a development candidate for its early-stage ASO program PRAX-100 in mid-2025.\nPRAX-100 is targeting SCN2A loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, a leading cause of monogenetic autism.\nPraxis shared pre-clinical data from four candidate ASOs showing significant increase in protein levels versus control in a humanized SCN2A mouse model, believed to be sufficient to offset the naturally occurring protein reduction seen in patients with SCN2A LoF mutations.\nPraxis remains on track to nominate development candidates for PRAX-080 and PRAX-090 by the end of 2025. PRAX-080 is targeting PCDH19 mosaic expression and PRAX-090 is designed to address SYNGAP1 LoF mutations.\nAbout Relutrigine (PRAX-562)\nRelutrigine is a first-in-class small molecule in development for the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) as a preferential inhibitor of persistent sodium current, shown to be a key driver of seizure symptoms in severe DEEs. Relutrigine’s mechanism of precision sodium channel (NaV) modulation is consistent with superior selectivity for disease-state NaV channel hyperexcitability. In vivo studies of relutrigine have demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of seizures up to complete control of seizure activity in SCN2A, SCN8A and other DEE mouse models. Relutrigine has been generally well-tolerated in three Phase 1 studies and has demonstrated biomarker changes indicative of NaV channel modulation. Data from Cohort 1 of the Phase 2 EMBOLD study demonstrated a well-tolerated, robust, short- and long-term improvement in motor seizures in a heavily pre-treated population alongside maintained seizure freedom in some patients with SCN2A- and SCN8A-DEE. Relutrigine has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE, SCN8A-DEE and Dravet syndrome, and ODD from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE and SCN8A-DEE. To learn more about the EMBOLD study, please visit\nhttps://www.emboldstudy.com/\n.\nAbout Elsunersen (PRAX-222)\nElsunersen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to selectively decrease SCN2A gene expression, directly targeting the underlying cause of early-onset SCN2A-DEE to treat seizures and other symptoms in patients with gain-of-function SCN2A mutations. In vitro studies of elsunersen have demonstrated reduction in both SCN2A gene expression and protein levels. In vivo, elsunersen has demonstrated significant, dose-dependent reduction in seizures, improvement in behavioral and locomotor activity and increased survival in SCN2A mouse models. Data from the Part 1 of the EMBRAVE study demonstrated well-tolerated, significant and sustained seizure reduction in patients with SCN2A-DEE. Elsunersen has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPD) from the FDA, and ODD and PRIME designations from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE. The Elsunersen program is ongoing under a collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IONS), and RogCon, Inc. To learn more about the EMBRAVE study, please visit\nhttps://www.embravestudy.org/\n.\nAbout Praxis\nPraxis Precision Medicines is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating insights from genetic epilepsies into the development of therapies for CNS disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance.

(NASDAQ: PRAX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating genetic insights into the development of therapies for central nervous system (CNS) disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance, today provided a corporate update and reported financial results for the first quarter 2025.\n“We have made substantial progress in advancing our promising late-stage epilepsy portfolio and are firing on all cylinders through this unpredictable time in the industry,” said Marcio Souza, president and chief executive officer of Praxis. “With multiple upcoming catalysts and data readouts, we expect a transformative year at Praxis. In the near-term, we anticipate topline results for vormatrigine from the RADIANT study in epilepsy by mid-2025, and from the POWER1 study in the second half of 2025. Vormatrigine continues to demonstrate an ideal profile and strong competitive differentiation”\nMr. Souza continued, “The registrational cohort of the EMBOLD study is recruiting strongly and is on-track for topline results no later than the first half of 2026, and we will soon initiate the registrational EMERALD study to investigate relutrigine more broadly in DEEs. The EMBRAVE study with elsunersen is progressing very well, with topline results expected in the first half of next year to support the registrational package, and we will initiate the Phase 3 EMBRAVE3 trial for elsunersen by mid-2025. While the interim analysis of Essential3 study 1 for ulixacaltamide was not what we expected, we are on track to complete both study 1 and study 2 for topline readout in the third quarter of this year. Our solid financial position ensures we have sufficient funding for all studies supporting our late-stage programs, with runway into 2028.”\nRecent Highlights and Anticipated Milestones\nCerebrum™ Small Molecule Platform\nVormatrigine for Focal Onset Seizures (FOS) and Generalized Epilepsy:\nAn estimated 3.5 million people in the U.S. suffer from common epilepsies. Sodium channel therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with epilepsy yet the currently approved drugs have significant safety and efficacy limitations. Vormatrigine is the most potent sodium-channel modulator ever designed to precisely target the hyperexcitable state of sodium-channels in adult common epilepsies.\nAt the American Association of Neurology (AAN) conference earlier this quarter, Praxis presented further data from recently completed Phase 1 studies\n[link]\n, where vormatrigine continued to demonstrate an ideal profile with strong competitive differentiation.\nResults from an additional 45 mg multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohort demonstrated a 20x exposure on the MES EC\n50\nscale achieved in subjects, the most of any anti-seizure medicine, with a tolerable safety profile.\nThe Phase 1 food effect study demonstrated that food intake does not significantly impact vormatrigine absorption and therefore vormatrigine can be administered with or without food, which increases flexibility in dosing and ease of use for patients.\nEnrollment and progress across the ENERGY program continues to advance\nPraxis provided an update on the EMPOWER registrational study\n[link]\nat AAN, which continues to attract epilepsy patients and be a source for identifying candidate patients for the RADIANT and POWER1 studies, with over 3,000 patients registered to date\nThe RADIANT Phase 2 study in FOS and generalized epilepsy is progressing, with topline results expected mid-year 2025\nThe POWER1 Phase 2/3 registrational study for treatment resistant FOS is enrolling, with topline results expected in the second half of 2025\nThe POWER2 Phase 2/3 registrational study for treatment resistant FOS is on track to initiate in the second half of 2025\nRelutrigine for DEEs:\nRelutrigine is a sodium channel modulator with therapeutic potential across developmental epilepsies. Relutrigine is currently being evaluated in the EMBOLD study in SCN2A and SCN8A DEEs, and we will be initiating the EMERALD study in a broader, pan-DEE patient population. Relutrigine has Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in three indications: SCN1A epilepsy (Dravet syndrome), SCN2A and SCN8A DEEs\nThe EMBOLD registrational cohort 2 continues to enroll strongly, with topline results expected no later than the first half of 2026, followed by potential NDA filing.\nPraxis has completed discussions with the FDA on a trial for broad DEEs and will initiate the EMERALD registrational study in mid-2025. The study design will be shared at today’s DEE virtual analyst event.\nUlixacaltamide for Essential Tremor (ET)\n: ET is an inadequately managed, undertreated and high burden disease with a prevalence of seven million patients in the U.S. The Essential3 program is the first Phase 3 study in the disease and includes two registrational studies: Study 1 is a parallel design, placebo-controlled study (N=400) and Study 2 is a randomized withdrawal study (N=200). Since beginning recruitment in November 2023, over 200,000 patients have demonstrated interest in participating in the study.\nOn February 28, Praxis shared the results of a pre-planned interim analysis of Study 1. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the study be stopped for futility, due to the results being unlikely to meet the primary efficacy endpoint under the parameters set by the statistical model.\nPraxis has decided to continue the studies to completion and will share topline results in the third quarter of 2025. After reviewing the results of both studies, Praxis will make a decision if there is sufficient evidence to support an NDA filing.\nSolidus™ Antisense Oligonucleotide (ASO) Platform\nElsunersen for early-seizure-onset SCN2A DEE:\nSCN2A GoF-DEE is a rare, genetic epilepsy characterized by early-onset seizures and severe impact on development. Praxis has two studies supporting its registrational filing.\nThe EMBRAVE Part A Phase 1/2 study is continuing to enroll. Patients are randomized 3:1 drug to sham for a six-month period on a once-monthly dose, with the potential to escalate from 1 mg to 8 mg. Topline results are expected in the first half of 2026.\nThe EMBRAVE3 registrational study for SCN2A GoF-DEE is on track to initiate in mid-2025. Cohort 1 of the study will enroll up to 40 patients ages 2 to 18 years, 1:1 between drug and sham for a six-month period with once monthly intrathecal dosing of 1 mg per visit, with a primary endpoint measuring reduction in seizure frequency. Cohorts 2 and 3 will evaluate patients from ages 1 to 2 and 0 to 1 years, respectively.\nIn April 2025, the experience of an emergency-use patient dosed on elsunersen was published in Nature Medicine\n[linkl\nproviding preliminary insights on the safety and efficacy of elsunersen in a preterm infant with early-onset SCN2A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.\nPraxis remains on track to nominate a development candidate for each of its early stage ASO therapeutic initiatives in 2025\nPRAX-080: Focused on targeting PCDH19 mosaic expression\nPRAX-090: Designed to address SYNGAP1 loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, a leading cause of severe intellectual disability and epilepsy in DEEs.\nPRAX-100: Targeting SCN2A LoF mutations, the predominant genetic link to de novo autism spectrum disorders (ASD).\nFirst Quarter 2025 Financial Results:\nAs of March 31, 2025, Praxis had $472.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared to $469.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024. The increase of $2.5 million is primarily attributable to net proceeds from at-the-market offerings of common stock offset by cash used in operating activities. The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, 2025 are expected to fund operations into 2028.\nPraxis did not recognize any collaboration revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $0.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease of $0.4 million is related to its Option and License Agreement with UCB. In December 2024, UCB exercised its option to in-license global development and commercialization rights for a KCNT1 small molecule development candidate, and as such, Praxis has no further research service obligations under the terms of the Option and License Agreement.\nResearch and development expenses were $60.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $27.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in research and development expenses of $33.8 million was primarily attributable to $29.9 million in increased expenses related to the Company’s Cerebrum™ platform, $1.9 million in increased personnel expenses, and $1.9 million in increased indirect expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $13.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $15.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.4 million was primarily due to $2.8 million in decreased personnel-related expenses, partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in indirect expenses.\nPraxis reported a net loss of $69.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, including $8.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, compared to $39.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, including $14.5 million of stock-based compensation.\nAs of March 31, 2025, Praxis had 20.3 million shares of common stock outstanding.\nAbout Vormatrigine (PRAX-628)\nVormatrigine is a next-generation, functionally selective small molecule targeting the hyperexcitable state of sodium-channels in the brain that is currently being developed as a once daily, oral treatment for adult focal onset seizures and generalized epilepsy. Preclinical data demonstrates vormatrigine is differentiated from standard of care, with the potential to be best-in-class for focal epilepsy. In vitro, vormatrigine has demonstrated superior selectivity for disease-state Na\nV\nchannel hyperexcitability. In vivo studies of vormatrigine have demonstrated unprecedented potency in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model, a highly predictive translational model for efficacy in focal epilepsy. Data from the study demonstrated that vormatrigine can be safely dosed in healthy subjects to greater than 20 times the predicted human equivalent of the rodent MES EC\n50\n. To learn more about the POWER1 study please visit\nPOWER1 study\n.\nAbout Relutrigine (PRAX-562)\nRelutrigine is a first-in-class small molecule in development for the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) as a preferential inhibitor of persistent sodium current, shown to be a key driver of seizure symptoms in early onset SCN2A-DEE and SCN8A-DEE. Relutrigine’s mechanism of sodium channel blocking is consistent with superior selectivity for disease state sodium channel (NaV) channel hyperexcitability. In vivo studies of relutrigine have demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of seizures up to complete control of seizure activity in SCN2A, SCN8A and other DEE mouse models. Relutrigine has been generally well-tolerated in three Phase 1 studies and has demonstrated biomarker changes indicative of NaV channel blocking effects. Relutrigine has received ODD and RPDD from the FDA, and ODD from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE and SCN8A-DEE and RPDD for Dravet Syndrome from the FDA. To learn more about the EMBOLD study, please visit\nEMBOLD study\n.\nAbout Ulixacaltamide\nUlixacaltamide is a differentiated and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of T-type calcium channels designed to block abnormal neuronal burst firing in the Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical (CTC) circuit correlated with tremor activity. Ulixacaltamide, the most advanced program within Praxis’ Cerebrum™ small molecule platform, is currently in late-stage development for the treatment of essential tremor,\nEssential3 study\n.\nAbout Elsunersen (PRAX-222)\nElsunersen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to selectively decrease SCN2A gene expression, directly targeting the underlying cause of early-seizure-onset SCN2A-DEE to treat seizures and other symptoms in patients with gain-of-function SCN2A mutations. In vitro studies of elsunersen have demonstrated reduction in both SCN2A gene expression and protein levels. In vivo, elsunersen has demonstrated significant, dose-dependent reduction in seizures, improvement in behavioral and locomotor activity and increased survival in SCN2A mouse models, with potential to be the first disease-modifying treatment for SCN2A-DEE. Elsunersen has received ODD and RPD from the FDA, and ODD and PRIME designations from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE. The elsunersen program is ongoing under a collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and RogCon, Inc. To learn more about the EMBRAVE study, please visit\nhttps://www.embravestudy.com/\n.\nAbout Praxis\nPraxis Precision Medicines is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating insights from genetic epilepsies into the development of therapies for CNS disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance.

Relutrigine’s mechanism of precision sodium channel (NaV) modulation is consistent with superior selectivity for disease-state NaV channel hyperexcitability. In vivo studies of relutrigine have demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of seizures up to complete control of seizure activity in SCN2A, SCN8A and other DEE mouse models. Relutrigine has been generally well-tolerated in three Phase 1 studies and has demonstrated biomarker changes indicative of NaV channel modulation. Data from the Phase 2 EMBOLD study demonstrated in a heavily pre-treated population a well-tolerated, robust, short- and long-term improvement in motor seizures alongside maintained seizure freedom in some patients with SCN2A- and SCN8A-DEE. Relutrigine has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA, and ODD from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE and SCN8A-DEE. To learn more about the EMBOLD study, please visit\nhttps://www.emboldstudy.com/\n.\nAbout Vormatrigine (PRAX-628)\nVormatrigine is a next-generation, functionally selective small molecule targeting the hyperexcitable state of NaV channels in the brain that is currently being developed as a once daily, oral treatment for adult focal onset seizures and generalized epilepsy. Preclinical data demonstrates vormatrigine is differentiated from standard of care, with the potential to be best-in-class for focal onset seizures. In vitro, vormatrigine has demonstrated superior selectivity for disease-state NaV channel hyperexcitability. In vivo studies of vormatrigine have demonstrated unprecedented potency in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model, a highly predictive translational model for efficacy in focal epilepsy. Data from the PRAX-628-101 study demonstrated that vormatrigine can be safely dosed in healthy subjects to greater than 15 times the predicted human equivalent of the rodent MES EC50, a translational indicator that suggests a therapeutic window with unprecedented magnitude relative to approved therapies.\nepilepsy-research.com\nAbout Elsunersen (PRAX-222)\nElsunersen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to selectively decrease SCN2A gene expression, directly targeting the underlying cause of early-onset SCN2A-DEE to treat seizures and other symptoms in patients with gain-of-function SCN2A mutations. In vitro studies of elsunersen have demonstrated reduction in both SCN2A gene expression and protein levels. In vivo, elsunersen has demonstrated significant, dose-dependent reduction in seizures, improvement in behavioral and locomotor activity and increased survival in SCN2A mouse models. Data from the EMBRAVE study demonstrated well-tolerated, significant and sustained seizure reduction in patients with SCN2A-DEE. Elsunersen has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPD) from the FDA, and ODD and PRIME designations from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE. The Elsunersen program is ongoing under a collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IONS), and RogCon, Inc.

(NASDAQ: PRAX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating genetic insights into the development of therapies for central nervous system (CNS) disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance, today provided an update on the interim analysis for Study 1 of the Essential3 program of ulixacaltamide in essential tremor (ET), an update on other therapies in development and a financial update.\nResults of the Planned Interim Analysis and Update on Topline Read-out for the Essential3 Program:\nThe Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) overseeing the interim analysis of Study 1 of the Essential3 program has provided Praxis with the outcome of such analysis. Based on the predefined decision framework for Study 1, the IDMC has recommended that the study be stopped for futility, due to the results being unlikely to meet the primary efficacy endpoint under the parameters set by the statistical model. The committee also indicated that some underlying assumptions of the statistical model might have influenced this outcome and encouraged Praxis to explore alternative analysis methods.\nGiven the advanced state of enrollment for both Study 1 and Study 2 in the Essential3 program, and in the context of the advice received by the IDMC, Praxis has decided to continue both studies to completion, with topline results expected in the third quarter of 2025. The decision about whether the data supports the submission of an NDA will be made after analyzing the final results for Study 1 and Study 2.\n“We are disappointed with and surprised by the outcome of the interim analysis for Study 1. Following the advice of the committee, we will explore different analysis methods for the final dataset, which is expected in the third quarter of 2025,” said Marcio Souza, president and chief executive officer of Praxis. “We remain focused on delivering on major near-term milestones in our other development programs, including the topline results from the RADIANT and POWER1 studies in focal onset seizures (FOS) and generalized epilepsy with vormatrigine, and the initiation of our EMERALD registrational study of relutrigine in developmental epilepsies and encephalopathies (DEEs) by mid-year 2025. We maintain a robust financial position that supports our continued investment in this exciting pipeline.”\nCorporate Updates, Recent Highlights and Anticipated Milestones:\nCerebrum™ Small Molecule Platform\nVormatrigine (PRAX-628) for Focal Onset Seizures and Generalized Epilepsy:\nThe ENERGY program continues to progress, with multiple topline readouts expected in 2025.\nThe\nEMPOWER observational study\n, in partnership with the Epilepsy Study Consortium, characterizing seizure burden, is ongoing with over 3,000 patients consented.\nEarly results\nwere shared during the Praxis scientific exhibit at the December 2024 American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting, demonstrating significant disease burden compounded by persistent, uncontrolled, often untracked seizures alongside profound psychosocial impact.\nPraxis has initiated the RADIANT Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study for FOS and generalized epilepsy assessing seizure burden with vormatrigine treatment, with topline results expected by mid-year 2025.\nPraxis has also initiated the POWER1 Phase 2/3 registrational study of vormatrigine for treatment resistant FOS, with topline results anticipated in the second half of 2025.\nPOWER2, the second registrational study for FOS, is on track to begin enrollment in the second half of 2025.\nRelutrigine (PRAX-562) for Developmental and Epileptic Epilepsies (DEEs):\nEMBOLD is currently enrolling patients with SCN2A and SCN8A DEEs in the registrational cohort 2, with topline results anticipated in the first half of 2026, followed by a potential NDA filing in 2026.\nIn December 2024, Praxis received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relutrigine for Dravet Syndrome. This is the third RPDD for relutrigine, in addition to SCN2A and SCN8A DEEs.\nFollowing recent regulatory interactions, Praxis anticipates initiating the EMERALD study for DEEs by mid-year 2025.\nSolidus™ Antisense Oligonucleotide (ASO) Platform\nElsunersen (PRAX-222) for early-seizure-onset SCN2A-DEE:\nFollowing discussions with global regulatory agencies, Praxis has finalized the registrational trial design. EMBRAVE3 will be a global, 24-week, double-blind, sham-procedure controlled study, with approximately 40 early-onset SCN2A-DEE patients, and is anticipated to start enrolling patients by mid-year 2025.\nThe second cohort of the EMBRAVE study evaluating safety and efficacy of elsunersen versus sham procedure continues enrolling patients in Brazil, with topline readout anticipated in the first half of 2026.\nAdditional Pipeline Updates:\nUCB exercised its option to in-license global development and commercialization rights for a KCNT1 small molecule development candidate. Praxis has earned an option exercise fee and is eligible to receive future success-based development and commercialization milestone payments, for a total of up to approximately $100 million, in addition to tiered royalties on net sales of any resulting products from the collaboration.\nPraxis remains on track to nominate a development candidate for each of its early stage ASO therapeutic initiatives in 2025\nPRAX-080: Focused on targeting PCDH19 mosaic expression which represents a pioneering approach to treating PCDH19-related epilepsy, a rare but devastating genetic disorder characterized by early-onset seizures and cognitive impairment, disproportionately affecting females.\nPRAX-090: Designed to address SYNGAP1 loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, a leading cause of severe intellectual disability and epilepsy in DEEs.\nPRAX-100: Targeting SCN2A LoF mutations, the predominant genetic link to de novo autism spectrum disorders (ASD).\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Financial Results:\nAs of December 31, 2024, Praxis had $469.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared to $81.3 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023. This increase of $388.2 million was primarily due to net proceeds from Praxis’ January 2024 and April 2024 follow-on public offerings and net proceeds from at-the-market sales of common stock, offset by cash used in operating activities. The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024 are expected to fund operations into 2028.\nPraxis recognized $7.5 million and $8.6 million in collaboration revenue during the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, respectively, related to its Option and License Agreement with UCB which was entered into in December 2022.\nResearch and development expenses were $56.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $18.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Research and development expenses were $152.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $86.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses for full year 2024 of $65.6 million was primarily attributable to a $61.9 million increase in expense related to Praxis’ Cerebrum™ platform, a $14.5 million increase in personnel-related costs and a $2.5 million increase in indirect expenses, partially offset by a $13.3 million decrease in expense related to Praxis’ Solidus™ platform.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $15.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $9.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. General and administrative expenses were $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses for full year 2024 of $14.2 million was primarily attributable to an $11.7 million increase in personnel-related costs, a $1.7 million increase in professional fees and a $0.9 million increase in other expenses.\nPraxis incurred a net loss of $58.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, including $8.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, compared to $26.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, including $5.7 million of stock-based compensation expense. Praxis reported a net loss of $182.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, including $41.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, compared to a net loss of $123.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, including $24.9 million of stock-based compensation expense.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Praxis had 19.4 million shares of common stock outstanding.\nAbout Ulixacaltamide\nUlixacaltamide is a differentiated and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of T-type calcium channels designed to block abnormal neuronal burst firing in the Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical (CTC) circuit correlated with tremor activity.

(NASDAQ: PRAX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating genetic insights into the development of therapies for central nervous system (CNS) disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance, today highlighted its portfolio progress and provided its business priorities for 2025.\n“2024 was a landmark year for Praxis with positive topline results from the Phase 2 photoparoxysmal response (PPR) trial of vormatrigine that led to initiating our ENERGY program in common epilepsies. Additional highlights this year were the unprecedented efficacy in cohort 1 of the EMBOLD study of relutrigine in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), followed by the initiation of the registrational cohort 2, and the continued overwhelming interest in the Essential3 program. Together, this progress has led to three blockbuster programs in late stage, with the potential for four product launches between 2026 and 2028,” said Marcio Souza, president and chief executive officer.\nMr. Souza continued, “We are now well positioned for a readout-rich 2025, with results anticipated for ulixacaltamide in the Essential3 program in ET followed by our first NDA filing, as well as topline results for vormatrigine from the RADIANT study in focal onset seizures (FOS) and generalized epilepsy, and the POWER1 study in FOS. We are also thrilled to have received a third rare pediatric drug designation (RPDD) for relutrigine in Dravet Syndrome, and with strong interest in cohort 2 of the EMBOLD study, we expect to file the NDA in 2026. With regulatory feedback on the elsunersen program, we expect to initiate the pivotal trial in the first half of 2025. We are sufficiently funded to advance all programs through their topline readouts, with runway into 2028. We look forward to providing a thorough update across our portfolio at the planned Investor R&D Day in the second quarter of 2025.”\nPortfolio updates and anticipated milestones\nCerebrum™ Small Molecule Platform\nUlixacaltamide for Essential Tremor\nET is an inadequately managed, undertreated and high burden disease with a prevalence of seven million patients in the U.S. The Essential3 program includes two Phase 3, registrational studies: Study 1 is a parallel design, placebo-controlled study (N=400) and Study 2 is a randomized withdrawal study (N=200). Since beginning recruitment in November 2023, over 100,000 patients have demonstrated interest in participating in the study.\nA pre-planned interim analysis of Study 1 is anticipated in the first quarter of 2025.\nAt the time of the interim analysis update, Praxis will provide further detail on timing for the full readouts of Study 1 and Study 2.\nPraxis anticipates filing the NDA for ulixacaltamide in 2025.\nFollowing positive results from Essential3, the Company plans to re-initiate a study of ulixacaltamide in Parkinson’s disease, where there is significant and unmet need for non-dopaminergic treatment options.\nVormatrigine (PRAX-628) for Common Epilepsies (Focal Onset Seizures and Generalized Epilepsy)\nAn estimated 3.5 million people in the U.S. suffer from common epilepsies. Sodium channel therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with epilepsy yet currently approved drugs have significant safety and efficacy limitations. Vormatrigine is the most potent sodium-channel modulator ever designed to precisely target the hyperexcitable state of sodium-channels in adult common epilepsies.\nIn recently completed Phase 1 studies, vormatrigine continued to demonstrate an ideal profile with strong competitive differentiation. Full results will be shared at an upcoming medical conference and highlights include:\nResults from an additional 45 mg multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohort showed a dose proportional increase in exposure with excellent tolerability, similar to the 20 and 30 mg MAD cohorts completed previously.\nA Phase 1 food effect study demonstrated that food intake does not affect vormatrigine absorption and therefore there is no need to take vormatrigine with food, which increases flexibility in dosing and ease of use.\nPraxis continues to make progress on the ENERGY program to advance vormatrigine through efficacy and registrational trials.\nThe\nEMPOWER observational study\n, in partnership with the Epilepsy Study Consortium, is aiming to better characterize seizure burden started enrolling patients in 2024 and has enrolled over 2,000 patients.\nEarly\nresults\nwere shared during the Praxis scientific exhibit at the December 2024 American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting. The RADIANT Phase 2 study for FOS and generalized epilepsy is currently enrolling patients, with topline results expected in the first half of 2025. RADIANT is an open-label study recruiting up to 50 patients with FOS or generalized epilepsy, who will be treated with a 30 mg dose over an 8-week period to evaluate the impact of vormatrigine on seizure burden.\nEnrollment for the POWER1 Phase 2/3 registrational study in patients with treatment resistant FOS is progressing as planned, with topline results anticipated in the second half of 2025. POWER1 is assessing adjunctive treatment, allowing dosing of vormatrigine on top of 1 to 3 antiseizure medications (ASMs), and aims to enroll approximately 250 patients in a parallel-arm study, comparing a treatment arm of 20 mg for 6 weeks followed by 30 mg for 6 weeks versus a placebo arm for 12 weeks.\nPOWER2 will be the second registrational study for vormatrigine and is expected to begin enrollment in the second half of 2025 as a three-arm, 12-week study.\nPraxis continues to evaluate the potential for expansion of one of its highly functionally selective compounds into pain indications. The program will be discussed at Praxis’ planned R&D Day in the second quarter of 2025.\nRelutrigine (PRAX-562) for Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies\nDEEs cover a wide range of genetically and phenotypically defined epileptic conditions that are often characterized by onset of seizures at or shortly after birth and occur in approximately 200,000 patients in the U.S. Relutrigine is a sodium channel modulator with therapeutic potential across developmental epilepsies. Relutrigine is currently being evaluated in the EMBOLD study in SCN2A and SCN8A DEEs, with future plans for the EMERALD study in a broader, pan-DEE patient population.\nIn cohort 1 of the EMBOLD study assessing relutrigine versus placebo in SCN2A gain-of-function (GoF) and SCN8A patients,\nrelutrigine showed\nunparalleled results\n, with an update on the open-label extension (OLE) shared at the 2024 AES Annual Meeting . Key results included:\n46% placebo-adjusted reduction in monthly motor seizures from baseline over a 16-week period.\nPatients continuing into the ongoing OLE (n=13) saw a 77% reduction in motor seizures from baseline through nine months of treatment.\nOver 30% of patients (n=5) achieved seizure freedom status while on relutrigine.\nPatients achieving seizure freedom had a median of 46 days of seizure freedom, inclusive of OLE period, compared to 3 days at baseline.\nMeaningful gains observed in alertness, communication and seizure severity suggest relutrigine has a disease modifying effect.\nRelutrigine was generally well-tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events or dose reductions required.\nEMBOLD is currently enrolling 80 patients with SCN2A and SCN8A DEEs in registrational cohort 2, with topline results anticipated in the first half of 2026, to be followed by an NDA filing later in 2026.\nIn December 2024, Praxis received RPDD for relutrigine for Dravet Syndrome. This is the third RPDD for relutrigine, in addition to SCN2A and SCN8A DEEs.\nPraxis remains on track to initiate the EMERALD registrational study in the first half of 2025.\nAt the 2024 AES Annual Meeting, Praxis shared\nan update\nfor an emergency use patient\nwith extended benefit achieved after receiving relutrigine\nSolidus™ Antisense Oligonucleotide (ASO) Platform\nElsunersen (PRAX-222) for early-seizure-onset SCN2A-DEE\nSCN2A GoF-DEE is a rare, genetic epilepsy characterized by early-onset and severe impact on development. The disease, as with all DEEs, affects not only the patient but also the entire caregiver ecosystem. In a Part 1 analysis of the EMBRAVE study, four patients receiving elsunersen over a four-month period achieved a 43% reduction in seizure burden compared to baseline.\nPraxis has completed discussions with global regulatory agencies to harmonize a registrational study design for elsunersen and will share the trial design and expected timelines in the first quarter of 2025.\nThe second cohort of the EMBRAVE study continues to enroll patients in Brazil, evaluating safety and efficacy of elsunersen versus sham procedure.\nAt the 2024 AES Annual Meeting, Praxis shared an\nupdate on four emergency access patient\ns\n, including updates from the first-in-patient case who has received elsunersen for over 15 months.\nAdditional Pipeline Updates\nIn December 2024, UCB exercised its option to in-license global development and commercialization rights for a KCNT1 small molecule development candidate as part of the strategic research collaboration established in December 2022. Praxis has earned an option exercise fee and is eligible to receive future success-based development and commercialization milestone payments, for a total of up to approximately $100 million, in addition to tiered royalties on net sales of any resulting products from the collaboration.\nPraxis remains on track to nominate a development candidate for each of its early stage ASO therapeutic initiatives in 2025\nPRAX-080: Focused on targeting PCDH19 mosaic expression which represents a pioneering approach to treating PCDH19-related epilepsy, a rare but devastating genetic disorder characterized by early-onset seizures and cognitive impairment, disproportionately affecting females.\nPRAX-090: Designed to address SYNGAP1 loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, a leading cause of severe intellectual disability and epilepsy in DEEs.\nPRAX-100: Targeting SCN2A LoF mutations, the predominant genetic link to de novo autism spectrum disorders (ASD).\nAbout Ulixacaltamide\nUlixacaltamide is a differentiated and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of T-type calcium channels designed to block abnormal neuronal burst firing in the Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical (CTC) circuit correlated with tremor activity. Ulixacaltamide, the most advanced program within Praxis’ Cerebrum™ small molecule platform, is currently in late-stage development for the treatment of essential tremor,\nEssential3 study\n.\nAbout Vormatrigine (PRAX-628)\nVormatrigine is a next-generation, functionally selective small molecule targeting the hyperexcitable state of sodium-channels in the brain that is currently being developed as a once daily, oral treatment for adult focal onset seizures and generalized epilepsy. Preclinical data demonstrates vormatrigine is differentiated from standard of care, with the potential to be best-in-class for focal epilepsy. In vitro, vormatrigine has demonstrated superior selectivity for disease-state Na\nV\nchannel hyperexcitability. In vivo studies of vormatrigine have demonstrated unprecedented potency in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model, a highly predictive translational model for efficacy in focal epilepsy. Data from the study demonstrated that vormatrigine can be safely dosed in healthy subjects to greater than 15 times the predicted human equivalent of the rodent MES EC\n50\n. To learn more about the POWER1 study please visit\nPOWER1 study\n.\nAbout Relutrigine (PRAX-562)\nRelutrigine is a first-in-class small molecule in development for the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) as a preferential inhibitor of persistent sodium current, shown to be a key driver of seizure symptoms in early onset SCN2A-DEE and SCN8A-DEE. Relutrigine’s mechanism of sodium channel blocking is consistent with superior selectivity for disease state sodium channel (NaV) channel hyperexcitability. In vivo studies of relutrigine have demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of seizures up to complete control of seizure activity in SCN2A, SCN8A and other DEE mouse models. Relutrigine has been generally well-tolerated in three Phase 1 studies and has demonstrated biomarker changes indicative of NaV channel blocking effects. Relutrigine has received ODD and RPDD from the FDA, and ODD from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE and SCN8A-DEE and RPDD for Dravet Syndrome from the FDA. To learn more about the EMBOLD study, please visit\nEMBOLD study\n.\nAbout Elsunersen (PRAX-222)\nElsunersen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to selectively decrease SCN2A gene expression, directly targeting the underlying cause of early-seizure-onset SCN2A-DEE to treat seizures and other symptoms in patients with gain-of-function SCN2A mutations. In vitro studies of elsunersen have demonstrated reduction in both SCN2A gene expression and protein levels. In vivo, elsunersen has demonstrated significant, dose-dependent reduction in seizures, improvement in behavioral and locomotor activity and increased survival in SCN2A mouse models, with potential to be the first disease-modifying treatment for SCN2A-DEE. Elsunersen has received ODD and RPD from the FDA, and ODD and PRIME designations from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE. The Elsunersen program is ongoing under a collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IONS), and RogCon, Inc. To learn more about the EMBRAVE study, please visit\nhttps://www.embravestudy.com/\n.\nAbout Praxis\nPraxis Precision Medicines is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating insights from genetic epilepsies into the development of therapies for CNS disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance.

ORX142 is an investigational, novel, highly potent and selective OX2R agonist being developed for the treatment of select neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. ORX142 is the second drug candidate from the Company’s multi-asset orexin franchise.\n“The clearance of our IND to initiate clinical studies of ORX142 represents a significant milestone, signaling the beginning of an exciting new phase in the clinical development of our OX2R agonist pipeline for indications beyond rare hypersomnias,” said Saurabh Saha MD PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Centessa. “With our most advanced OX2R agonist, ORX750, advancing in the Phase 2a\nCRYSTAL-1\nstudy for the treatment of narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), we are eager to leverage our insights from this new drug class and explore ORX142’s potential to treat a broad range of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders with significant unmet needs. We are excited to begin executing our ORX142 Phase 1 clinical study in acutely sleep-deprived healthy volunteers which is aimed at generating early proof-of-concept data for ORX142 this year which we expect to enable a dose selection for planned studies evaluating ORX142 in patients.”\nThe Phase 1 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses (SAD) and multiple-ascending doses (MAD) of ORX142 in healthy volunteers. In parallel to the SAD, a placebo-controlled crossover pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment will be performed utilizing the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) in acutely sleep-deprived healthy adult subjects. The Company plans to initiate the first-in-human Phase 1 clinical study imminently, with clinical data expected this year.\nAbout Centessa’s Orexin Receptor 2 (OX2R) Agonist Program\nOrexin is a neuropeptide that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, leading to arousal and promoting wakefulness. Targeting the orexin pathway with novel orexin receptor 2 (OX2R) agonists represents a promising approach to address excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), impaired attention, cognitive deficits and fatigue associated with a broad range of neurological, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Centessa is developing a pipeline of potential best-in-class OX2R agonists, including ORX750 for the treatment of sleep-wake disorders including narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), ORX142 for the treatment of select neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, and ORX489 for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. ORX750 is being evaluated in the Phase 2a\nCRYSTAL-1\nstudy. ORX750, ORX142 and ORX489 are investigational candidates and have not been approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority.\nAbout Centessa Pharmaceuticals\nCentessa Pharmaceuticals, plc\nis a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company with a mission to discover, develop and ultimately deliver medicines that are transformational for patients.

ORX750 is progressing in the Phase 2a\nCRYSTAL-1\nstudy and is on track with patient data expected across all three indications this year. Given the unmet patient need for new treatment options, the team is intensely focused on execution to carry this momentum forward into registrational studies, as quickly as possible.”\n“In parallel, we continue to advance our pipeline of potential first-in-class follow-up OX2R agonists for the treatment of neurological, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. More specifically, we are on track to initiate first-in-human studies of ORX142 with clinical data in acutely sleep-deprived healthy volunteers planned for this year. With multiple data readouts expected across our OX2R agonist pipeline, we believe this will be another transformative year for Centessa and for the OX2R agonist class overall,” said Dr. Saha.\nRecent Highlights\nIn April 2025, additional data from the Phase 1 study of ORX750 were presented in a poster session at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting. In addition to showing previously disclosed Phase 1 data, the poster featured the time-course curves of the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) results from the 5.0 mg dose cohort. These data showed that at the 5.0 mg dose sustained effects were observed throughout the 8-hour post dose observation period in both mean sleep latency on the MWT (>30 minutes) and in KSS scores, compared to placebo. The Company believes that the totality of the Phase 1 data continues to support ORX750’s profile as a potential best-in-class OX2R agonist for the treatment of NT1, NT2 and IH, with first-in-class potential in NT2 and IH.\nOX2R Agonist Pipeline and Anticipated Upcoming Milestones\nORX750\n: The Phase 2a\nCRYSTAL-1\nstudy is ongoing in participants with NT1, NT2 and IH, with data from all three indications planned in 2025.\nORX142\n: Subject to IND clearance, the Company plans to initiate first-in-human studies with the goal of sharing clinical data in acutely sleep-deprived healthy volunteers in 2025.\nORX489\n: Currently in IND-enabling studies.\nFirst Quarter 2025 Financial Results\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\n: Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $424.9 million as of March 31, 2025.

Data from the Phase 1 study of ORX750 showed compelling activity in acutely sleep-deprived healthy volunteers at low doses with a favorable initial safety and tolerability profile. Based on the strength of these data, we believe ORX750 has the potential to be best-in-class and to enable the full range of doses required to meet the needs of patients living with NT1, NT2 and IH. We look forward to sharing data this year and expect the Phase 2a study to enable dose selection for future registrational studies of ORX750.”\nDr. Saha concluded, “In addition to the transformational potential of ORX750 for individuals living with sleep-wake disorders, we see tremendous opportunity with our follow-up OX2R agonists that are being advanced for the treatment of EDS, impaired attention, cognitive deficits and fatigue in neurological, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. ORX142 is progressing in IND-enabling studies, and subject to IND clearance, we expect to initiate clinical development and share clinical data in acutely sleep-deprived healthy volunteers this year. We are also pleased to have ORX489, our most potent OX2R agonist to date based on preclinical data, advancing in IND-enabling studies. With this ongoing momentum across our pipeline, we expect 2025 to be an exciting, data-rich year for Centessa.”\nRecent Highlights\nIn January 2025, the Company shared positive data from the Phase 1 clinical study of ORX750, a highly potent and selective OX2R agonist, in healthy volunteers as of December 5, 2024, the most recent data cutoff date. These data showed ORX750 significantly increased wakefulness in acutely sleep-deprived healthy volunteers compared to placebo at all doses tested, with a clear dose response. More specifically, in the 2.5 mg (n=8), 3.5 mg (n=10) and 5.0 mg (n=8) dose cohorts, ORX750 was shown to restore normative wakefulness with mean sleep latencies (MSL) >30 minutes (out of a score of 40 minutes) as measured by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT); the 5.0 mg dose cohort achieved an MSL of 38 minutes, compared to 15 minutes for placebo. A favorable safety and tolerability profile was observed with all treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) being transient with none leading to treatment discontinuation. There were no cases of hepatotoxicity or visual disturbances observed. Additionally, there were no clinically significant treatment-emergent changes in hepatic and renal parameters, vital signs or ECG parameters. These data also showed linear pharmacokinetics (PK) with a profile that supports the use of ORX750 as a once-daily oral dosing regimen with rapid absorption. The Company believes these data continue to support ORX750’s profile as a potential best-in-class OX2R agonist for the treatment of NT1, NT2 and IH, with first-in-class potential in NT2 and IH. Data from the Phase 1 study of ORX750 will be presented in a poster session at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting on April 5, 2025.\nIn November 2024, the Company announced the initiation of the Phase 2a\nCRYSTAL-1\nstudy of ORX750 in participants with NT1, NT2 and IH.\nPipeline and Anticipated Upcoming Milestones\nORX750\n: Phase 2a\nCRYSTAL-1\nstudy ongoing in participants with NT1, NT2 and IH. The Company expects to share Phase 2a data across all three indications in 2025. In addition, data from the Phase 1 study will be presented in a poster session at the AAN Annual Meeting on April 5, 2025.\nORX142\n: Advancing through IND-enabling studies.

There are separate cohorts for each indication. Initial dosing is 1.0 mg for NT1 and 2.0 mg for NT2 and IH with sequential dose escalation/de-escalation between cohorts. Each dosing cohort consists of a 6-week treatment duration with crossover study design. During the 6 weeks of treatment, each participant will be randomized to one of two blinded treatment sequences and receive a total of 4 weeks of treatment with ORX750 and 2 weeks of treatment with placebo. Efficacy assessments will evaluate the effect of ORX750 on excessive daytime sleepiness (using the MWT and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)), cataplexy (NT1 only) and overall symptom improvement (measured by Narcolepsy Severity Scale (NSS) and Idiopathic Hypersomnia Severity Scale (IHSS)). Other exploratory assessments include measures of sleep, cognition, attention, memory and general health.\nAbout Centessa Pharmaceuticals\nCentessa Pharmaceuticals, plc\nis a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company with a mission to discover, develop and ultimately deliver medicines that are transformational for patients.

The study achieved its primary endpoint as well as all key secondary endpoints. At Day 29, a single 12 mg dose of BPL-003 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms, as measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), with a mean decrease of 11.1 points from baseline compared to a 5.8 point reduction in the 0.3 mg comparator group (p = 0.0038). For the key secondary efficacy endpoints, a single 8 mg dose of BPL-003 also showed significant improvement at Day 29, with a mean MADRS score reduction of 12.1 points (p=0.0025 for change vs. 0.3 mg control). Notably, both the 8mg and 12mg doses of BPL-003 showed statistically significant improvements in MADRS scores as early as one day after dosing, with effects generally maintained out to Week 8.\nSafety and efficacy results from this study support the selection of the 8 mg dose of BPL-003 for advancement into Phase 3 clinical studies. atai and Beckley Psytech plan to engage with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other applicable agencies regarding the Phase 3 trial design for patients with treatment-resistant depression in the coming months.\nWith these positive Phase 2b results, the pre-agreed success criteria for the proposed strategic combination between atai and Beckley Psytech, which was\nannounced in June 2025,\nhas been achieved and the strategic combination is now expected to progress to atai shareholder approval stage. The atai Beckley combination is expected to create a global leader in short time in-clinic psychedelic-based mental health therapies.\nCosmo Feilding Mellen, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Beckley Psytech, said\n:\n“The achievement of our primary and secondary endpoints in this study represents an important milestone in the development of BPL-003 and reinforces its potential to be a viable treatment option for patients and healthcare systems. We are particularly encouraged that a single 8 mg or 12 mg dose of BPL-003 showed rapid and durable efficacy results, favourable tolerability and a short time in-clinic, giving us important flexibility in optimising the design of future trials. Thank you to all of the patients and study partners who participated in this study - we now look forward to preparing for end-of-Phase 2 meetings with regulators and moving forward with our strategic combination with atai Life Sciences to form atai Beckley, a global leader in psychedelic-based mental health treatments.”\nThe Phase 2b clinical study was conducted at 38 sites across six countries and enrolled a total of 193 patients with moderate-to-severe TRD (defined as non-response to two or more prior treatments in the current depressive episode) (\nNCT05870540\n). It is the largest controlled clinical study to investigate mebufotenin and the only blinded Phase 2b study of mebufotenin to include the United States. Patients were randomized to receive a single 12 mg (n=73), 8 mg (n=46), or 0.3 mg comparator (n=74) dose of BPL-003 and were followed for eight weeks with efficacy assessments conducted by centralised, blinded raters using the MADRS at Day 2, Day 8, Day 29 and Day 57.\nKey efficacy findings:\nA single 12 mg dose of BPL-003 led to a mean reduction in MADRS score from baseline of 11.1 points compared with 5.8 points in the 0.3 mg comparator arm (p=0.0038) at Day 29, with the 8 mg dose arm showing a mean MADRS reduction from baseline of 12.1 points versus the 0.3mg comparator arm (p=0.0025) at that same timepoint.\nThe 8 mg and 12 mg doses of BPL-003 demonstrated equivalent efficacy suggesting the 8 mg dose may be sufficient to achieve therapeutic benefit from a single dose.\nThe difference in MADRS scores between the 8 mg and 12 mg doses versus the 0.3 mg dose were statistically significant in both active arms from as early as Day 2, with mean MADRS reductions from baseline of 8.8 points in the 8 mg group and 8.9 points in the 12 mg group observed at that timepoint, compared to a reduction from baseline of 3.9 points in the 0.3 mg group. These mean reductions from baseline increased to 11.1 points in the 8 mg group and 10.8 points in the 12 mg group at Day 8.\nA durable effect was also observed for both higher doses, with the 8 mg group showing a mean reduction of 10.8 points from baseline at Day 57 and the 12 mg group showing a mean reduction of 10.2 points from baseline compared with the 0.3 mg group (5.2 point reduction). These findings highlight the potential of BPL-003 to be a durable treatment for patients with TRD.\nKey safety findings:\nBPL-003 was generally well-tolerated at all doses. More than 99% of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate and there were no drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs).\nDose related increases in administration site discomfort, nausea, headache, blood pressure and anxiety suggest the 8mg dose was better tolerated than the 12mg dose.\nNo participants in the 8 mg nor 12 mg arms had any instance of treatment-emergent suicidal intent or behaviour, indicating no suicide-related safety signal observed to date.\nThe average time to meet readiness for discharge criteria across all arms was within two hours of dosing, with the majority of patients deemed ready for discharge at the 90 minutes post-dose assessment. This, alongside the administration of BPL-003 via a previously approved nasal spray device, supports the potential of BPL-003 to fit within the existing interventional psychiatry treatment paradigm that has been successfully established by Spravato\n®\n.\nThe study had a low drop-out rate with 90% of patients completing the core study.\nThese findings suggest a favourable tolerability profile which are consistent with earlier Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies of BPL-003, as well as other psychedelic studies within the class.\nAdditional data from the core study is expected to be shared through publications and medical meetings in the future.\nDr David Feifel,\nProfessor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego and Director of the Kadima Neuropsychiatry Institute\nsaid:\n“\nWhat stands out in these results is that a single administration of BPL-003 in patients with treatment-resistant depression was generally well tolerated and produced a robust antidepressant effect that emerged rapidly and was solidly sustained for at least two months. Notably, the acute psychedelic effects were shorter than with most other psychedelics studied clinically, suggesting potential for a quicker functional recovery for patients and a reduced need for prolonged monitoring. If a treatment with this profile were available today, it would immediately become my treatment of choice for TRD.”\nFollow-up in the eight-week open-label extension (OLE) stage of the study is ongoing. The OLE study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a second 12 mg dose of BPL-003 administered to patients eight weeks after dosing in the core study. 85% of eligible subjects from the core stage of the study have enrolled into the OLE. Data from the OLE study is expected in the third quarter of 2025 and will provide additional insights into the safety and tolerability of repeat dosing, as well as the durability of BPL-003’s antidepressant effect.\nCommenting on the news, Srinivas Rao, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of atai, said:\n“These findings strengthen our confidence in the potential of BPL-003 to be a transformative psychedelic therapy, offering rapid and durable antidepressive effects with minimal in-clinic time for patients with treatment-resistant depression. We look forward to engaging with the regulators later this year to advance this innovative treatment into Phase 3 clinical development.”\nConference Call\natai and Beckley Psytech will host a conference call and live webcast today Tuesday, July 1, 2025, 2025 at 8:00 a.m. EDT.

We believe that the unified business will be even better positioned to accelerate development, drive long-term value for shareholders, and - most importantly - deliver meaningful innovation for patients.”\n“This transaction marks a pivotal milestone in delivering on the strategic vision we set forth from the start of atai in 2018: to be the leader in the psychedelic space,” added Christian Angermayer, Co-Founder and Chairman of atai. “I am also very pleased to announce the concurrent financing with existing investors from both companies.

The study builds on previously reported open-label results which demonstrated that a single dose of BPL-003, when given as a\nmonotherapy\nor\nalongside SSRIs\n, was well-tolerated and could produce a rapid and lasting antidepressant effect for up to three months.\nFinancial Synergies and Strong IP Portfolio\n:\nCash runway through multiple Phase 2 clinical catalysts, near and long-term operational synergies, as well as a strong IP portfolio with granted U.S. patents out to 2043.\nUnified Vision and Team:\nThe new entity is expected to leverage the expertise, teams, and networks of both organizations to accelerate the development and commercialization of transformative mental health treatments.\nTransaction Terms\natai made a strategic investment in Beckley in January 2024. Under the terms of the deal, Beckley’s shareholders (other than atai) will be issued approximately 105 million new shares as consideration for the remaining shares of Beckley not presently held by atai. These newly issued shares equate to approximately 31% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, based on the treasury stock method, upon closing of the transaction and the concurrent private placement, and value Beckley at approximately $390 million.\nThese newly issued atai shares are subject to a lock-up wherein, following the completion of the lock-up period, 1/12 of the shares are released every month. Additionally, Apeiron Investment Group, the family office of Mr. Angermayer, voluntarily entered into a similar lock-up agreement covering all of its shares in atai.\nBeckley also intends to distribute Eleusis Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries, which hold assets and funding related to its second clinical-stage asset, ELE-101, out of Beckley prior to closing of the transaction.\nTiming and Approvals\natai’s Supervisory Board and Management Board and Beckley’s Board of Directors have approved the transaction.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to approval of the share issuance by the shareholders of atai and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\nConcurrent Financing\nConcurrent with the transaction, atai also executed a $30.0 million private placement with Ferring Ventures S.A. and Adage Capital Partners LP.

The findings show that a single dose of BPL-003, when given to patients who were also taking defined selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), was well-tolerated, with rapid and durable antidepressive effects of up to three months with an average in-clinic treatment time of less than two hours following dosing.\n“We’re very encouraged by the growing body of data supporting BPL-003 as a potentially differentiated and commercially scalable interventional psychiatric treatment for depression,” stated Srinivas Rao, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of atai. “Patients with treatment-resistant depression face limited options and these results show that a single dose of BPL-003 can deliver rapid and durable antidepressant effects when co-administered with an SSRI, extending the positive results observed in the Part 1 monotherapy study. Although a small, open-label study, the data validates the co-administration approach, which could improve accessibility in the real-world setting. Congratulations to Cosmo, Rob and the Beckley team for continued execution of the BPL-003 program, and we look forward to the Phase 2b readout mid-year.”\nThe open-label Phase 2a study investigated the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of BPL-003 in 12 patients with moderate-to-severe depression, who had failed to respond to at least two or more prior treatments and were taking defined SSRIs. Patients were followed for 12 weeks post-dosing with assessments conducted at multiple points throughout the study.\nBPL-003 was also shown to be well-tolerated. All adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and there were no serious adverse events reported (SAEs). Furthermore, acute effects resolved on the day of dosing with patients deemed dischargeable within an average time of less than two hours after dosing.\nA single dose of BPL-003 induced rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects, with a mean MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) reduction of 18 points from baseline observed the day after dosing, a mean MADRS reduction of 19 points from baseline observed one month after dosing, and a mean MADRS reduction of 18 points from baseline observed three months after dosing.\nThese findings demonstrate the potential of BPL-003 to deliver a commercially scalable single dose treatment model, if approved, that fits within the current interventional psychiatric care model established by Spravato\n®\n.\nThe results are also consistent with initial results from Part 1 of the study, which investigated BPL-003 as a monotherapy. Data from that study showed that a single dose of BPL-003 was well-tolerated and produced a rapid and lasting antidepressant effect for up to three months after dosing.\nBeckley Psytech is expecting results from the core, randomized, quadruple-masked stage of its Phase 2b study of BPL-003 for TRD in mid-2025. The study enrolled 196 patients, which is the largest ever controlled clinical study to investigate mebufotenin and the only blinded Phase 2b study of mebufotenin in the United States. Data from the study will be used to support end-of-Phase 2 meetings with regulatory bodies and Phase 3 planning.\nAbout BPL-003\nBPL-003 is Beckley Psytech’s patent-protected, proprietary intranasal formulation of mebufotenin benzoate, administered via a nasal spray device used in a previously approved drug product. BPL-003 is designed to deliver rapid and durable antidepressant effects from a single dose, with a short time in the clinic and is being investigated as a potential therapy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) and for alcohol use disorder (AUD). BPL-003 is covered by granted US, UK and European composition-of-matter patents, with multiple further claims pending in various jurisdictions.\nAbout Treatment-Resistant Depression\nDepression is a debilitating and life-changing condition affecting nearly 300 million people across the globe, with around 52 million people affected by the condition in Europe and the US combined. Treatment resistant depression occurs when an individual does not respond to two or more courses of antidepressants and some studies show that it may affect up to 50% of those living with depression, meaning there is a significant unmet need for more effective treatments.\nAbout Beckley Psytech\nBeckley Psytech Ltd. is a private clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of people with neuropsychiatric disorders through the development of rapid-acting, short-duration psychedelic medicines. In January 2024, atai made a strategic investment in Beckley Psytech, resulting in an approximate one third ownership stake and 1:1 warrant coverage at a 30% premium on the primary issuances. atai holds a time-limited right of first refusal on a future sale of the company and an indefinite right of first negotiation for BPL-003 and ELE-101. atai and Beckley Psytech also agreed to collaborate on digital therapeutics, commercial and market access activities in preparation for future potential commercialization.\nAbout atai Life Sciences\natai is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company on a mission to develop highly effective mental health treatments to transform patient outcomes.

We also look forward to several key milestones this year, notably Beckley Psytech’s BPL-003 Phase 2b topline results in patients with treatment-resistant depression as well as RL-007 in patients with cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, both expected mid-2025.”\nRecent Clinical Highlights and Upcoming Milestones\nVLS-01: N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD)\nVLS-01 is an investigational proprietary oral transmucosal film formulation of DMT applied to the buccal surface, designed to fit within the established two-hour interventional psychiatry treatment paradigm.\nDosed the first patient in Elumina, a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of repeated doses of VLS-01 in patients with TRD.\nTopline data from the Phase 2 Elumina trial of VLS-01 are anticipated in the first quarter of 2026.\nEMP-01: R-enantiomer of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (R-MDMA) for social anxiety disorder (SAD)\nEMP-01 is an oral formulation of R-MDMA that demonstrated a unique, dose-dependent subjective effect profile in a Phase 1 trial that was generally found to be more similar to classical psychedelics than to racemic MDMA.\nInitiated an exploratory Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of EMP-01 in adults with SAD.\nTopline data from the Phase 2 study of EMP-01 are anticipated in the first quarter of 2026.\nBPL-003: 5-Methoxy N,N-dimethyltryptamine (mebufotenin) benzoate for TRD and alcohol use disorder (AUD) (strategic investment in Beckley Psytech)\nBPL-003 is an intranasal transmucosal formulation of mebufotenin benzoate designed to fit within the established two-hour interventional psychiatry treatment paradigm.\nIn March 2025, Beckley Psytech completed patient enrollment in the eight-week, double-blind, core stage of the global Phase 2b clinical trial of BPL-003 in 196 patients with TRD. Topline results from the core phase of the study are expected in mid-2025.\nIn January 2025, Beckley Psytech announced positive topline data from its open-label Phase 2a study of BPL-003 in 12 patients with moderate-to-severe AUD. Initial data demonstrated that a single dose of BPL-003, combined with relapse prevention therapy, produced meaningful and sustained reductions in alcohol use, with 50% of patients maintaining complete abstinence out to three months and was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported.\nRL-007: Pro-cognitive neuromodulator for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) (strategic investment in Recognify Life Sciences)\nRL-007 is an orally bioavailable compound that has demonstrated pro-cognitive effects in multiple pre-clinical and clinical studies, including two Phase 1 and two Phase 2 trials.\nRecognify Life Sciences is running a Phase 2b proof-of-concept study in 234 patients living with CIAS. Topline results are expected in mid-2025.\nConsolidated Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term securities:\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term securities of $72.3 million compared to $154.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of $81.9 million was primarily driven by $82.4 million net cash used in operating activities, $15.0 million for the Beckley Psytech investment, and $7.7 million of additional investments to advance our programs; partially offset by $16.1 million in proceeds from the partial sale of our ADS holdings in Compass Pathways, and $5.0 million in proceeds from our committed term loan with Hercules Capital, Inc. In February 2025, the Company completed an equity offering with net proceeds of $59.2 million and now expects its cash, short-term securities, and public equity holdings to be sufficient to fund operations into 2027.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses:\nR&D expenses were $18.9 million and $55.5 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, as compared to $14.2 million and $62.2 million for the comparable prior year periods. The year-over-year full-year decrease of $6.7 million was primarily attributable to a $5.5 million decrease in R&D personnel-related expenses and a $1.4 million decrease in program-specific expenses. The overall decrease in program-specific spend relates to the wind-down of certain programs, offset by the increase in on-going clinical trials and our non-hallucinogenic discovery program. The Company is anticipating R&D spend to increase as its R&D programs progress into later stage clinical trials.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses:\nG&A expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024 were $11.3 million and $47.5 million, respectively, as compared to $19.4 million and $63.6 million for the comparable prior year periods. The year-over-year full-year decrease of $16.0 million was primarily attributable to a $16.2 million decrease in personnel-related expenses and professional services. The Company expects the reduction in G&A spend over prior years to continue.\nNet income (loss):\nNet loss attributable to shareholders for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was $39.0 million and $149.3 million, respectively, as compared to $18.3 million and $40.2 million for the comparable prior year periods. Net loss attributable to shareholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 includes $48.9 million of non-cash decrease in fair value of assets and liabilities, net and $25.5 million of non-cash share-based compensation. Net loss attributable to shareholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 includes $86.6 million of non-cash increase in fair value of assets and liabilities, net, of which $69.0 million relates to a one-time accounting change, and $33.0 million of non-cash share-based compensation.\nAbout atai Life Sciences\natai is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company on a mission to develop highly effective mental health treatments to transform patient outcomes.

With VLS-01, we see the potential to offer rapid, robust, and durable antidepressant effects that could provide meaningful relief where existing treatments fall short. This trial brings us one step closer to delivering a new and innovative solution to those people who need it most.\"\nElumina is a Phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of repeated doses of VLS-01 (\nNCT06524830\n). The trial consists of two treatment periods. In the first treatment period, approximately 142 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive a 120mg dose of VLS-01 or placebo on Day 1, followed by a second dose of the same intervention at Week 2. The primary endpoint is the change from Baseline in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at Week 4. The last double-blind assessment visit will be at Week 14. The first treatment period will provide 12 weeks of blinded durability data following two doses of VLS-01 administered in a placebo-controlled fashion. Topline results from the first treatment period are anticipated in the first quarter of 2026.\nThe second treatment period starts at Week 14 and will explore the response to two different dose levels of VLS-01. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive a third dose of either 60mg or 120mg of VLS-01. Final safety and efficacy assessment will be conducted two weeks after administration of the third dose.\nAbout VLS-01 (buccal film DMT)\nVLS-01 is a proprietary oral transmucosal film formulation of N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) applied to the buccal surface, being developed for the treatment of people suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

BPL-003 is Beckley Psytech’s patent-protected, proprietary intranasal formulation of mebufotenin benzoate, administered via a nasal spray device used in a previously approved drug product. BPL-003 is designed to deliver rapid and durable effects from a single dose, with a short time in clinic. Topline results from the core stage of the Phase 2b clinical trial are expected in mid-2025.\n“We are impressed by the Beckley Psytech team’s execution of the Phase 2b clinical trial of BPL-003 in patients with treatment-resistant depression, which is the largest controlled trial of mebufotenin and the first and only Phase 2b clinical trial to investigate mebufotenin in the U.S.,” stated Srinivas Rao, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of atai. “The promising data from earlier clinical studies of BPL-003 have demonstrated that a single dose can induce rapid, significant, and lasting antidepressant effects, further reinforcing our confidence in its potential to revolutionize treatment for difficult-to-treat depression. We look forward to the topline results from the eight-week core stage of the Phase 2b clinical trial of BPL-003, which remains on track for mid-2025.”\nThe eight-week, quadruple-masked, dose-finding, core stage of the Phase 2b clinical trial (\nNCT05870540\n) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of a single medium (8mg) or high (12mg) dose of BPL-003 against a sub-perceptual dose. The trial enrolled 196 patients with moderate-to-severe depression that had failed to respond to at least two or more prior treatments in the current episode of depression across 38 sites in six countries. Patients are followed for eight weeks, and efficacy is assessed at various timepoints by centralized, blinded raters using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).\nThe eight-week, open-label, extension stage of the Phase 2b clinical trial continues to enroll patients to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a second high dose of BPL-003 administered after the completion of the core stage of the trial.\nData from the Phase 2b clinical trial will be used in conjunction with data from the Phase 2a study of BPL-003 in patients with TRD to support end-of-Phase 2 meetings with regulatory bodies and Phase 3 planning in the second half of 2025. Initial Phase 2a data showed that a single 10mg dose of BPL-003 can produce a rapid and lasting antidepressant effect, with 55% of patients meeting the criteria for remission (MADRS ≤10) at Day 29 and 45% meeting the criteria for remission at Day 85. BPL-003 only required a short time in clinic, with patients deemed dischargeable within an average time of less than two hours after dosing.\nAbout BPL-003\nBPL-003 is Beckley Psytech’s patent-protected, proprietary intranasal formulation of mebufotenin benzoate, administered via a nasal spray device used in a previously approved drug product.

BPL-003 is a patent-protected synthetic intranasal formulation of 5-MeO-DMT benzoate designed to deliver rapid and durable treatment effects from a single dose with a short in-clinic treatment time. The results showed that a single dose of BPL-003, in combination with relapse prevention cognitive behavioral therapy, induced meaningful and sustained reduction in alcohol use and heavy drinking days (HDDs) in patients with moderate to severe AUD out to 12 weeks.\n“We are encouraged by these exploratory results from Beckley Psytech, our strategic investment, which demonstrate the potential of short in-clinic psychedelic therapies to transform the treatment of substance use disorders,” stated Dr. Srinivas Rao, CEO and Co-founder of atai. “The high rates of sustained abstinence in this study are particularly promising given the significant challenges patients with alcohol use disorder face in achieving and maintaining abstinence. These findings add to the growing body of evidence supporting the potential of BPL-003 in treating serious mental health disorders. We look forward to the Phase 2b data readout of BPL-003 in treatment-resistant depression expected mid-year.”\nThe 12-week Phase 2a open-label study enrolled 12 patients with moderate to severe AUD and evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic effects and impact on alcohol use of a single dose of BPL-003, in combination with relapse prevention cognitive behavioral therapy (\nNCT05674929\n). The results demonstrated meaningful and sustained reductions in alcohol use following a single dose of BPL-003:\nMean number of alcohol units consumed per day decreased from 9.3 units to 2.2 units at Week 12\nMean percentage of HDDs, defined as consuming seven or more units of alcohol per day for women and nine or more units of alcohol per day for men, declined from 56% to 13% at Week 12\nMean number of abstinent days increased from 33% to 81% at Week 12\n50% of the patients remained completely abstinent through the 12-week study\nBPL-003 was shown to be well-tolerated with adverse events (AEs) being reported as mild or moderate and there were no serious or severe adverse events reported. Most patients were assessed as ready for discharge within approximately two hours.\nBeckley Psytech plans to evaluate future development options for BPL-003 in substance use disorders and anticipates reporting additional clinical data from this study in publications and conferences in 2025.\nAbout Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)\nAUD is a medical condition characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences. The World Health Organization estimates that around 400 million people suffer with AUD worldwide, with around 3 million deaths each year attributed to the harmful use of alcohol. Currently available pharmacological treatment options are not very effective and some people with alcohol use disorder who wish to abstain from, or reduce, alcohol consumption do not achieve their treatment goal with currently approved treatment options. This contributes to an unmet need for more effective medical treatments.\nAbout BPL-003\nBPL-003 is Beckley Psytech’s patent-protected synthetic intranasal 5-MeO-DMT benzoate formulation, designed to deliver rapid and durable effects from a single dose, with a short time in clinic. PL-003 is being investigated for treatment resistant depression (TRD) and for alcohol use disorder (AUD). In a Phase 2a study TRD study, a single 10mg dose of BPL-003 produced a rapid antidepressant response in 55% of patients at Day 1, with 55% of patients in remission at Day 29 and 45% in remission at Day 85. BPL-003 demonstrated a short treatment duration, with patients deemed ready to be discharged within an average of less than two hours. Topline Phase 2b data are anticipated mid-2025.\nAbout Beckley Psytech Ltd\nBeckley Psytech Ltd. is a private clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of people with neuropsychiatric disorders through the development of rapid-acting, short-duration psychedelic medicines. In January 2024,\natai made a strategic investment in Beckley Psytech\n, resulting in a 35.5% ownership stake and 1:1 warrant coverage at a 30% premium on the primary issuances. atai holds a time-limited right of first refusal on a future sale of the company and an indefinite right of first negotiation for BPL-003 and ELE-101. atai and Beckley Psytech also agreed to collaborate on digital therapeutics, commercial and market access activities in preparation for future potential commercialization.\nAbout atai Life Sciences\natai is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company aiming to transform the treatment of mental health disorders.

This is a key milestone and an important step towards the potential of commercially scalable short-duration psychedelic therapies for people with treatment-resistant depression.”\nAs announced in May 2024, Co-Founder Srinivas Rao, M.D., Ph.D., was promoted to Co-CEO effective June 1, 2024, and assumed the role of CEO on January 1, 2025. Dr. Rao has over 24 years of diverse biotechnology and pharmaceutical experience, having held the titles of Chief Scientific, Medical, and Executive Officer at companies ranging from venture-backed startups to vertically integrated, publicly traded pharmaceutical companies.\nKevin Craig, M.D., has been named CMO to head clinical development for VLS-01 (buccal film DMT) and EMP-01 (R-MDMA). Dr. Craig served as atai’s Senior Vice President of Clinical Development since July 2023 and he leads the entirety of atai’s clinical-stage research & development effort, clinical development, patient safety, clinical operations, regulatory affairs, biostatistics and all other clinical functions.

Before joining the industry, Dr. Craig held a faculty appointment at the Behavioral and Clinical Neuroscience Institute at the University of Cambridge and has published widely on cognition and brain imaging in mental health. He received his medical degree from the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, and his MPhil from the University of Cambridge.

Dr. Short has served as Senior Vice President of Early Development since August 2022 and has been a member of atai’s leadership team since 2019. He has over 20 years of industry and research experience and has been involved in numerous programs that leverage cutting-edge biotechnologies to develop new therapies to address unmet medical needs in oncology, immunology, neurological disease, and pain. Dr. Short holds a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Virginia and conducted his postdoctoral training in Molecular Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School in Boston.\nGerd Kochendoerfer, Ph.D., has been named COO to foster strategic alignment and operational excellence as the company progresses its key clinical programs.

Dr. Kochendoerfer holds a Ph.D. in Chemistry from UC Berkeley, is an inventor on multiple patents and has published more than 25 papers in peer-reviewed literature.\nAbout VLS-01 (buccal film DMT)\nVLS-01 (VLS-01-BU) is a proprietary oral transmucosal film formulation of N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) applied to the buccal surface, being developed for people living with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Pharmacologically, DMT is a partial agonist of the 5-HT 1A/2A/2C receptors, developed to induce a short duration of psychedelic effect. Clinical evidence suggests that administration of intravenous (IV) DMT results in rapid-acting and durable antidepressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder. The buccal film formulation is designed with the aim to eliminate the need for IV administration, provide improved pharmacokinetics (PK) compared to such route of administration, and maximize the therapeutic potential to fit into the established two-hour in-clinic treatment paradigm. atai is conducting a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, trial (\nNCT06524830\n) to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of multiple doses of VLS-01 in people with TRD. Topline data from the Phase 2 study is anticipated in the first quarter of 2026.\nAbout EMP-01 (R-MDMA)\nEMP-01 is a proprietary oral formulation of the R-enantiomer of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) being developed for the treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD). EMP-01's pharmacology is more targeted than racemic MDMA, preferentially targeting the serotonergic system with less activation of other biological targets associated with some side effects observed with racemic MDMA. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, EMP-01 was well-tolerated and found to produce subjective experiences and altered states that were more similar to those of classic psychedelics than racemic MDMA, with participants also reporting having an introspective experience, emotional breakthroughs, and increased self-compassion. atai plans to initiate an exploratory Phase 2a placebo-controlled clinical trial in the first quarter of 2025 to assess the safety and efficacy of two doses of EMP-01 in adults with SAD. Topline data from the Phase 2a study is anticipated in the first quarter of 2026.\nAbout atai Life Sciences\natai is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company aiming to transform the treatment of mental health disorders.

(NASDAQ: TARS), today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025.\n“Tarsus has entered 2025 with incredible momentum, driven by strong execution of our category-creating strategic blueprint for success and a focused commitment to leadership in eye care. The XDEMVY launch is continuing to exceed our expectations and is on track to potentially become one of the best-selling anterior segment medicines,” said Bobak Azamian, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Tarsus. “Building on a foundation of strong commercial performance and the success of our recent equity offering, we believe we are well positioned to accelerate the growth of XDEMVY, create another new category in Ocular Rosacea and continue to advance our pipeline.”\nRecent Business and Clinical Highlights\nXDEMVY is on track to potentially be one of the fastest growing and best-selling anterior segment medicines. In the first quarter, the Company:\nGenerated $78.3 million in XDEMVY net product sales, an increase of 217% year over year and 18% over Q4 2024.\nDispensed approximately 72,000 bottles of XDEMVY to patients, an increase of 23% over Q4 2024.\nBroad commercial, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement of XDEMVY now extends to more than 90% of covered lives.\nRecognized a gross-to-net discount of approximately 47%.\nSubstantially increased the depth of prescribing among our target Eye Care Professionals (ECPs).\nAt the end of Q1 2025, the number of ECPs writing more than one prescription per week increased by nearly 110% compared to Q3 2024.\nDirect-To-Consumer (DTC) advertising drove a 140% increase in the average weekly website visits in March 2025 compared to December 2024.\nOngoing investment expected to increase alongside leading indicators of utilization.\nPresented new data showing the global prevalence and real-world patient burden of\nDemodex\nblepharitis (DB).\nThe Elara study showed the high prevalence and significant impact of DB in Japan, consistent with the U.S.\nResults of the Orion registry showed XDEMVY-treated patients experienced meaningful improvements in some of the most impactful symptoms of disease, including fluctuating vision, redness, itchy eyelids, burning or stinging, dryness and crusted eyes.\nThe combined data from the Ersa and Rhea studies in DB patients with Meibomian Gland Disease (MGD) showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements of the meibomian glands, with at least three times more glands secreting normal or clear liquid in XDEMVY-treated patients compared to vehicle at day 43.\nStrengthened financial position with a $134.8 million upsized public equity offering which will continue to fund the launch of XDEMVY and ongoing pipeline investment.\nContinued to advance a robust pipeline with multiple catalysts expected in 2025.\nOn-track to initiate a Phase 2 study of TP-04 (lotilaner ophthalmic gel) for Ocular Rosacea, a highly prevalent and underserved eye disease with no FDA-approved therapy, in H2 2025.\nAnticipated to meet with regulatory authorities in Japan in H2 2025 to help determine a regulatory path forward for XDEMVY in Japan.\nOn-track for potential European regulatory approval in 2027 of a preservative-free formulation of XDEMVY.\nOn-track to initiate a Phase 2 study of TP-05 (an investigational oral tablet) for the potential prevention of Lyme disease in 2026.\nFirst\nQuarter\n2025\nFinancial Results\nProduct sales, net:\nwere $78.3 million compared to $24.7 million for the same period in 2024, driven by approximately 72,000 bottles of XDEMVY delivered to patients compared to approximately 26,000 bottles delivered in the prior year period.\nCost of sales:\nwere $5.2 million compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2024, due to manufacturing costs incurred after the approval of XDEMVY, the royalty we pay on net product sales, and the amortization of the milestones paid to our licensor, which is being amortized over its remaining useful life of 8.4 years.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses:\nwere $14.4 million compared to $12.1 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily due to $0.5 million of increased TP-04 program expenses, $0.9 million of increased payroll and personnel-related costs, $0.9 million of increased early-stage programs, and $0.3 million of increased other indirect expenses. These increases were partially offset by $0.4 million of decreased TP-03 program expenses. Total R&D non-cash stock compensation expense was $1.5 million, which was consistent with $1.5 million in the same period in 2024.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses:\nwere $85.0 million compared to $51.6 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was due primarily to $9.6 million of increased payroll and personnel-related costs (including non-cash stock-based compensation), and $25.6 million of increased commercial and marketing costs, including direct-to-consumer advertising costs, as we continued our commercial expansion of XDEMVY. These increases were partially offset by $1.9 million of decreased information technology applications, legal, professional and other corporate expenses. Total SG&A non-cash stock compensation expense was $5.3 million, compared with $3.9 million in the same period in 2024.\nNet loss:\nwas $25.1 million, compared to $35.7 million for the same period in 2024. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 was $(0.64), compared with $(1.01) for the same period in 2024.\nCash position:\nAs of March 31, 2025, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $407.9 million.\nConference Call and Webcast\nTarsus will host a conference call and webcast to discuss its first quarter 2025 financial results and business highlights today, May 1, 2025, at 1:30 p.m. P.T. / 4:30 p.m. ET. A live webcast will be available on the events section of the Tarsus\nwebsite\n. A recorded version of the call will be available on the website shortly after the completion of the call and will be archived there for at least 90 days.\nAbout XDEMVY\n®\nXDEMVY (lotilaner ophthalmic solution) 0.25%, formerly known as TP-03, is a novel prescription eye drop designed to treat\nDemodex\nblepharitis by targeting and eradicating the root cause of the disease –\nDemodex\nmite infestation. XDEMVY was evaluated in two pivotal trials collectively involving more than 800 patients. Both trials met the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints, with statistical significance and no serious treatment-related adverse events. Most patients found the XDEMVY eye drop to be neutral to very comfortable. The most common ocular adverse reactions observed in the studies were instillation site stinging and burning which was reported in 10% of patients. Other ocular adverse reactions reported by less than 2% of patients were chalazion/hordeolum (stye) and punctate keratitis.\nXDEMVY Indication and Important Safety Information\nINDICATIONS AND USAGE\nXDEMVY is indicated for the treatment of\nDemodex\nblepharitis.\nMost common side effects\n: The most common side effect in clinical trials was stinging and burning in 10% of patients. Other side effects in less than 2% of patients were chalazion/hordeolum and punctate keratitis.\nFor additional information, please see full prescribing information available at:\nhttps://xdemvy.com/\n.\nAbout TP-03\nTP-03 (lotilaner ophthalmic solution) 0.25% is a novel therapeutic designed to treat\nDemodex\nblepharitis by targeting and eradicating the root cause of disease –\nDemodex\nmite infestation. It was approved by the FDA in 2023 under the brand name XDEMVY® for the treatment of\nDemodex\nblepharitis. Lotilaner is a well-characterized anti-parasitic agent that paralyzes and eradicates\nDemodex\nmites by selectively inhibiting parasite-specific gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride (GABA-Cl) channels. It is a highly lipophilic molecule, which may promote its uptake in the oily sebum of the eye lash follicles where the mites reside.\nAbout TP-04\nTP-04 is an investigational aqueous gel formulation of lotilaner, a well-characterized anti-parasitic agent that paralyzes and kills mites by selectively inhibiting parasite-specific GABA-Cl channels. Tarsus is studying TP-04 for the treatment of Ocular Rosacea (OR).\nAbout TP-05\nTP-05 is an investigational oral systemic formulation of lotilaner, a well-characterized anti-parasitic agent that selectively inhibits parasite-specific GABA-Cl channels. TP-05 is believed to be the only non-vaccine, drug-based, preventative therapeutic in development designed to kill ticks to potentially prevent Lyme disease transmission.\nAbout Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nTarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. applies proven science and new technology to revolutionize treatment for patients, starting with eye care. Tarsus is advancing its pipeline to address several diseases with high unmet need across a range of therapeutic categories, including eye care, dermatology, and infectious disease prevention. XDEMVY (lotilaner ophthalmic solution) 0.25% is FDA approved in the United States for the treatment of\nDemodex\nblepharitis. Tarsus is also developing TP-04 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea and TP-05 as an oral tablet for the prevention of Lyme disease, all of which are in Phase 2.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release about future expectations, plans and prospects, as well as any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, may constitute “forward-looking statements.” These statements include statements regarding the potential commercial success and growth of XDEMVY in\nDemodex\nblepharitis, including market size, acceptance, demand, prescription fill rate and adoption rate for XDEMVY; our ability to successfully implement and continue our new direct-to-consumer campaign; our ability to achieve and maintain distribution and patient access for XDEMVY and timing and breadth of payer coverage; our ability to continue to educate the market about\nDemodex\nblepharitis; our ability to initiate planned clinical studies; anticipated regulatory and development milestones including potential Europe and Japan regulatory pathways and approval for XDEMVY; the results of our clinical studies; the test results of our pipeline formulations; our ability to continue investing in our business, and the quotations of Tarsus’ management. The words, without limitation, “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would,” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these or similar identifying words. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include: Tarsus is heavily dependent on the successful commercialization of its lead product, XDEMVY for the treatment of\nDemodex\nblepharitis and the development and regulatory approval and commercialization of its current and future product candidates; Tarsus’ ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize its products, including XDEMVY for the treatment of\nDemodex\nblepharitis, and its product candidates to meet existing and future regulatory standards; Tarsus has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur significant expenses and losses for the foreseeable future; Tarsus’ capital requirements are difficult to predict and may change; Tarsus may need to obtain additional funding to achieve its goals and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force Tarsus to delay, reduce, or eliminate its product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations; Tarsus may not be successful in educating healthcare professionals and the market about the need for treatments specifically for\nDemodex\nblepharitis and other diseases targeted by XDEMVY or our product candidates; the development and commercialization of Tarsus products is dependent on intellectual property it licenses from Elanco Tiergesundheit AG; Tarsus expects to expand its development, regulatory, operational, sales, and marketing capabilities and Tarsus may encounter difficulties in managing its growth, which could disrupt its operations; the sizes of the market opportunity for XDEMVY and Tarsus’ product candidates, particularly TP-04 for the treatment of Ocular Rosacea, as well as TP-05 for the prevention of Lyme disease, have not been established with precision and may be smaller than estimated; the results of Tarsus’ earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future results; any termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, Tarsus’ planned clinical trials could result in increased costs, delay or limit its ability to generate revenue and adversely affect its commercial prospects; if Tarsus is unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for its product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, Tarsus’ competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to Tarsus’ products; and if Tarsus is unable to access capital (including but not limited to cash, cash equivalents, and credit facilities) and/or loses capital, as a result of potential failure of any financial institutions that Tarsus does business with directly or indirectly. Further, there are other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements and they are detailed from time to time in the reports Tarsus files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Tarsus’ Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed on February 25, 2025 and the most recent Form 10-Q quarterly filing filed with the SEC on May 1, 2025, which Tarsus incorporates by reference into this press release, copies of which are posted on its website and are available from Tarsus without charge. However, new risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements contained in this earnings release are based on the current expectations of Tarsus’ management team and speak only as of the date hereof, and Tarsus specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nMedia Contact:\nAdrienne Kemp\nSr. Director, Corporate Communications\n(949) 922-0801\nakemp@tarsusrx.com\nInvestor Contact:\nDavid Nakasone\nHead of Investor Relations\n(949) 620-3223\nDNakasone@tarsusrx.com\nTARSUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nCONDENSED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2025\n2024\nRevenues:\nProduct sales, net\n$\n78,335\n$\n24,720\nLicense fees and collaboration revenue\n—\n2,894\nTotal revenues\n78,335\n27,614\nOperating expenses:\nCost of sales\n5,211\n1,654\nResearch and development\n14,409\n12,066\nSelling, general and administrative\n84,995\n51,578\nTotal operating expenses\n104,615\n65,298\nLoss from operations before other income (expense)\n(26,280\n)\n(37,684\n)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest income\n3,454\n3,117\nInterest expense\n(2,213\n)\n(983\n)\nOther income (expense), net\n(81\n)\n(181\n)\nTotal other income (expense), net\n1,160\n1,953\nNet loss\n$\n(25,120\n)\n$\n(35,731\n)\nUnrealized gain (loss) on marketable securities and cash equivalents\n(94\n)\n(61\n)\nComprehensive loss\n$\n(25,214\n)\n$\n(35,792\n)\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted\n$\n(0.64\n)\n$\n(1.01\n)\nWeighted-average shares outstanding, basic and diluted\n39,345,359\n35,300,655\nTARSUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nCONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share and par value amounts)\nMarch 31, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\n(unaudited)\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n175,787\n$\n94,819\nMarketable securities\n232,129\n196,557\nAccounts receivable, net\n62,426\n46,760\nInventory\n2,705\n2,620\nOther receivables\n1,727\n1,299\nPrepaid expenses\n5,999\n14,650\nTotal current assets\n480,773\n356,705\nRestricted cash, non-current\n2,563\n2,562\nInventory, non-current\n2,532\n2,533\nProperty and equipment, net\n2,787\n2,314\nIntangible assets, net\n8,086\n8,326\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n393\n552\nLong-term investments\n3,000\n3,000\nOther assets\n616\n999\nTotal assets\n$\n500,750\n$\n376,991\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and other accrued liabilities\n$\n76,375\n$\n64,789\nAccrued payroll and benefits\n9,933\n15,823\nTotal current liabilities\n86,308\n80,612\nLong-term debt, net\n71,984\n71,845\nTotal liabilities\n158,292\n152,457\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value; 10,000,000 authorized; no shares issued and outstanding\n—\n—\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value; 200,000,000 shares authorized; 41,995,537 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2025 (unaudited); 38,349,826 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024\n6\n6\nAdditional paid-in capital\n727,697\n584,559\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n85\n179\nAccumulated deficit\n(385,330\n)\n(360,210\n)\nTotal stockholders’ equity\n342,458\n224,534\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity\n$\n500,750\n$\n376,991"

Additionally, Siemens will contribute technical input as Aduro begins preparing for the design of a demonstration plant (the “\nDemonstration Plant\n”).\n“Our vision to deliver a modular, scalable chemical recycling solution with Hydrochemolytic™ Technology takes another step forward today,” commented Ofer Vicus, CEO of Aduro. “Partnering with Siemens—an organization recognized globally for engineering excellence and industrial innovation—enhances the foundation we’re building. Their technologies will help ensure our Pilot Plant operates safely and reliably while generating the high-quality process data needed to optimize performance and support Demonstration Plant planning. This collaboration strengthens our path to commercialisation and supports our ability to scale with confidence.”\nHydrochemolytic™ Technology (HCT), developed by Aduro, uses water as a reactive medium at moderate temperatures to selectively cleave carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds in polymers. Unlike pyrolysis, which relies on extreme heat and broad thermal cracking, HCT operates under catalytic conditions that enable greater controls over reaction pathways. This selective chemistry enables in higher conversion rate of polymers into lighter, more valuable hydrocarbons that are stable and do not require further hydrogenation. The process also reduces energy input and minimal formation of undesired by-products such as gases, char or heavy tars. The Pilot Plant, currently under construction by Zeton Inc., is a fully instrumented, continuous-flow unit designed to validate the HCT process under real-world operating conditions. As a key scale-up from the earlier R2 continuous flow reactor, the Pilot Plant will provide engineering data, system learnings, and process insights necessary to inform the design and deployment of future demonstration and commercial facilities.\nSiemens brings valuable experience from its work with chemical recycling companies, supporting the scale-up of emerging processes through advanced automation, control, and digitalization technologies. Its collaboration with Aduro reflects an interest in helping enable the next generation of recycling platforms—solutions that are differentiated, energy-efficient, and aligned with the principles of a circular economy.\nSiemens’ PCS neo system allows for seamless automation across plant modules, secure remote access, and centralized data acquisition, giving Aduro precise control over key variables in the Hydrochemolytic™ process. The platform also supports digital twin development—helping simulate, test, and optimize process conditions virtually before implementing physical changes. These tools will be essential as Aduro prepares to move from the Pilot Plant to future commercial-scale operations. While the immediate focus is on delivering automation and control systems for the Pilot Plant, Siemens will also provide engineering services to support scale-up planning for the Demonstration Plant. These contributions include insights into process optimization, digital infrastructure, and plant design—drawing on Siemens’ global experience with innovative recycling projects.\nJoris Myny, Senior Vice President, Digital Industries, Siemens Canada, said: “At Siemens, we are committed to supporting advanced recycling technologies that enable circularity and reduce environmental impact. Aduro’s Hydrochemolytic™ process offers a compelling alternative to conventional methods, and we’re proud to bring our automation and digitalization expertise to help scale it. With our PCS neo platform, we’re enabling real-time visibility, control, and flexibility—key factors in optimizing plant performance and supporting long-term growth. This collaboration reflects our support of innovators who are redefining how materials are recovered and reused.”\nAbout Aduro Clean Technologies\nAduro Clean Technologies is a developer of patented water-based technologies to chemically recycle waste plastics; convert heavy crude and bitumen into lighter, more valuable oil; and transform renewable oils into higher-value fuels or renewable chemicals. The Company’s Hydrochemolytic™ technology relies on water as a critical agent in a chemistry platform that operates at relatively low temperatures and cost, a game-changing approach that converts low-value feedstocks into resources for the 21\nst\ncentury.\nFor further information, please contact:\nAbe Dyck, Head of Business Development and Investor Relations\nir@adurocleantech.com\n+1 226 784 8889\nKCSA Strategic Communications\nJack Perkins, Senior Vice President\naduro@kcsa.com\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements.

XDEMVY was evaluated in two pivotal trials collectively involving more than 800 patients. Both trials met the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints, with statistical significance and no serious treatment-related adverse events. Most patients found the XDEMVY eye drop to be neutral to very comfortable. The most common ocular adverse reactions observed in the studies were instillation site stinging and burning which was reported in 10% of patients. Other ocular adverse reactions reported by less than 2% of patients were chalazion/hordeolum (stye) and punctate keratitis.\nXDEMVY Indication and Important Safety Information\nIndications and Usage\nXDEMVY (lotilaner ophthalmic solution) 0.25% is indicated for the treatment of\nDemodex\nblepharitis.\nImportant Safety Information\nMost common side effects:\nThe most common side effect in clinical trials was stinging and burning in 10% of patients. Other side effects in less than 2% of patients were chalazion/hordeolum and punctate keratitis.\nHandling the Container:\nAvoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye, surrounding structures, fingers, or any other surface in order to minimize contamination of the solution. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions.\nWhen to Seek Physician Advice\n: Immediately seek a physician’s advice concerning the continued use of XDEMVY if you develop an intercurrent ocular condition (e.g., trauma or infection), have ocular surgery, or develop any ocular reactions, particularly conjunctivitis and eyelid reactions.\nUse with Contact Lenses:\nXDEMVY contains potassium sorbate, which may discolor soft contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of XDEMVY and may be reinserted 15 minutes following its administration.\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Tarsus Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-421-4002 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or\nwww.fda.gov/medwatch\n.\nFor additional information please see\nFull Prescribing Information\navailable at:\nwww.xdemvy.com\n.\nAbout Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nTarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. applies proven science and new technology to revolutionize treatment for patients, starting with eye care.

(NASDAQ: SCWO) (“374Water”) (the “Company”), a global leader in waste destruction technology for the municipal, federal, and industrial markets, today announced peer reviewed preliminary data demonstrating AirSCWO’s 99.9999% destruction of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) in aqueous film-forming foam (“AFFF”).\nPublished\nin the National Ground Water Association (“NGWA”) Journals, the article by Craig Divine, et al. with Arcadis, titled “Solutions for Managing Aqueous Film-Forming-Foam- (AFFF-) Impacted Infrastructure” details the enormity of the AFFF problem, outlines the immense challenges of treating AFFF solutions and infrastructure, and highlights 374Water’s AirSCWO as a potential solution at scale.\nAFFF, a critical tool in combating flammable liquid and gas fires, including petroleum, greases, tars, oils, oil-based paints, solvents and alcohols, has long been utilized by sectors such as municipal firefighting, aviation, military and petrochemical industries. AFFF’s effectiveness stems from its unique composition, which includes per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”). However, PFAS are highly persistent in the environment and pose significant risks to human health and ecosystems, necessitating urgent measures for their safe destruction. The U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) and the European Union (“EU”) have introduced stringent regulations, including the transition to fluorine-free firefighting foams in 2024. In addition, multiple states have implemented buyback programs to support this transition and safely dispose of AFFF stocks.\n“The enormity of the AFFF PFAS problem across the federal, municipal and industrial landscapes presents an opportunity for 374Water to scale rapidly,” said Chris Gannon, CEO of 374Water. “374Water’s AirSCWO system has consistently shown PFAS >99.9999% destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) operating at commercial scale. We are excited by the potential of AirSCWO to provide a permanent solution to dispose of this waste, and we are actively building our destruction services business to support growing demand.”\n“There is a significant need for efficient, cost-effective, sustainable, and adaptive options for the destruction of stockpiles of AFFF,” the authors explain. As SCWO technology continues to mature, solutions such as 374Water’s AirSCWO can “provide significant value across the US DoD portfolio, civil aviation, and other industrial sectors.”\nThe Arcadis article specifies four different waste types found at AFFF remediation sites: AFFF concentrate, rinsate solutions, cleaning agents, and contaminated solid wastes. With the exception of solid wastes, the “aqueous wastes may be managed on-site using…PFAS destruction technologies,” the authors note. Despite traditional disposal methods such as landfilling which are still in wide use, the authors acknowledge the residual “long-term liability for the waste,” persisting. They go on to say, SCWO “may alleviate any future liability of the waste…that the other options do not.”\n“We are elated to participate in this waste destruction demonstration showcasing the effectiveness of 374Water’s commercial-scale AirSCWO technology,” says Howard Teicher, 374Water’s VP of Government. “It is an honor to partner with the Federal government, state and local municipalities, and industrial customers to provide commercial-scale solutions to address PFAS and other waste destruction needs.”\nNGWA Journal article can be found here:\nhttps://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gwmr.12703?af=R\nArcadis published a brief podcast discussion of the article, which can be found here:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gwmr-solutions-for-managing-afff-impacted-infrastructure/id1560891120?i=1000693686449\nAbout 374Water\n374Water Inc.

XDEMVY was evaluated in two pivotal trials collectively involving more than 800 patients. Both trials met the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints, with statistical significance and no serious treatment-related adverse events. Most patients found the XDEMVY eye drop to be neutral to very comfortable. The most common ocular adverse reactions observed in the studies were instillation site stinging and burning which was reported in 10% of patients. Other ocular adverse reactions reported by less than 2% of patients were chalazion/hordeolum (stye) and punctate keratitis.\nXDEMVY Indication and Important Safety Information\nINDICATIONS AND USAGE\nXDEMVY is indicated for the treatment of\nDemodex\nblepharitis.\nMost common side effects\n: The most common side effect in clinical trials was stinging and burning in 10% of patients. Other side effects in less than 2% of patients were chalazion/hordeolum and punctate keratitis.\nFor additional information, please see full prescribing information available at:\nhttps://xdemvy.com/\n.\nAbout TP-04\nTP-04 is an investigational aqueous gel formulation of lotilaner, a well-characterized anti-parasitic agent that paralyzes and kills mites by selectively inhibiting parasite-specific GABA-Cl channels. Tarsus is studying TP-04 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea.\nAbout TP-05\nTP-05 is an investigational oral systemic formulation of lotilaner, a well-characterized anti-parasitic agent that selectively inhibits parasite-specific GABA-Cl channels. TP-05 is believed to be the only non-vaccine, drug-based, preventative therapeutic in development designed to kill ticks to potentially prevent Lyme disease transmission.\nAbout Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nTarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. applies proven science and new technology to revolutionize treatment for patients, starting with eye care. Tarsus is advancing its pipeline to address several diseases with high unmet need across a range of therapeutic categories, including eye care and infectious disease prevention.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include: Tarsus is heavily dependent on the successful commercialization of its lead product, XDEMVY for the treatment of\nDemodex\nblepharitis and the development and regulatory approval and commercialization of its current and future product candidates; Tarsus’ ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize its products, including XDEMVY for the treatment of\nDemodex\nblepharitis, and its product candidates to meet existing and future regulatory standards; Tarsus has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur significant expenses and losses for the foreseeable future; Tarsus’ capital requirements are difficult to predict and may change; Tarsus may need to obtain additional funding to achieve its goals and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force Tarsus to delay, reduce or eliminate its product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations; Tarsus may not be successful in educating healthcare professionals and the market about the need for treatments specifically for\nDemodex\nblepharitis and other diseases targeted by XDEMVY or our product candidates; the development and commercialization of Tarsus products is dependent on intellectual property it licenses from Elanco Tiergesundheit AG; Tarsus expects to expand its development, regulatory, operational and sales and marketing capabilities and Tarsus may encounter difficulties in managing its growth, which could disrupt its operations; the sizes of the market opportunity for XDEMVY and Tarsus’ product candidates, particularly TP-04 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea, as well as TP-05 for the potential prevention of Lyme disease, have not been established with precision and may be smaller than estimated; the results of Tarsus’ earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future results; any termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, Tarsus’ planned clinical trials could result in increased costs, delay or limit its ability to generate revenue and adversely affect its commercial prospects; if Tarsus is unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for its product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, Tarsus’ competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to Tarsus’ products; and if Tarsus is unable to access capital (including but not limited to cash, cash equivalents, and credit facilities) and/or loses capital, as a result of potential failure of any financial institutions that Tarsus does business with directly or indirectly. Further, there are other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements and they are detailed from time to time in the reports Tarsus files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Tarsus’ Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 planned to be filed on February 25, 2025, which Tarsus incorporates by reference into this press release, copies of which are or will be posted on its website and are available from Tarsus without charge. However, new risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risk factors and uncertainties.

(NASDAQ: TARS) today provided an update on the Company’s key priorities for 2025, including plans to advance TP-04 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea, another category-creating opportunity in eye care.\n“2024 was a groundbreaking year for Tarsus as we established XDEMVY as one of the most successful eye care launches to date. With consistent quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, rapid physician adoption, broad payer coverage to date, and continued acceleration in the number of bottles delivered to patients in the fourth quarter of 2024, our path to eye care leadership is clear,” said Bobak Azamian, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Tarsus. “I expect 2025 to be even more transformational as we turn up the dial on key strategic launch initiatives, plan to generate more new evidence highlighting the impact of XDEMVY and our pipeline candidates, and pursue Ocular Rosacea as the next potentially revolutionary opportunity in eye care.”\nXDEMVY (lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25%) – Driving One of the Fastest Growing Categories in Eye Care\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, the Company delivered more than 104,000 bottles of XDEMVY to patients and generated more than $113 million in XDEMVY net product sales.\nBy the end of Q3 2024, more than 13,000 Eye Care Professionals (ECPs) were prescribing XDEMVY with over 70% writing for multiple patients.\nBroad commercial and Medicare reimbursement now extends to more than 80% of lives covered and a gross-to-net discount percentage in the low 40s as of the end of Q3 2024.\nThe deployment of approximately 50 new sales representatives and leaders in Q3 2024 started to deliver meaningful impact in Q4 2024.\nThe Company initiated a trial run of its first direct-to-consumer advertising campaign on network TV in January 2025, including spots during the Golden Globes and National Football League (NFL) playoffs.\nGroundbreaking data from the Ersa and Rhea clinical trials for the treatment of\nDemodex\nblepharitis (DB) in patients with Meibomian Gland Disease (MGD) further underscore the utility of XDEMVY broadly across DB patient types.\nOcular Rosacea – Pursuing The Next Potentially Transformative Category in Eye Care\nOcular Rosacea (OR) is a highly prevalent, undertreated eye disease with no FDA-approved therapy. It affects ~15-18 million Americans, and more than half of all cases are caused by an infestation of\nDemodex\nmites. This inflammatory condition affects the eyes and surrounding tissue and is often accompanied by the presence of prominent blood vessels, and redness across the eyes and eyelids.\nTP-04 is an investigational topical sterile ophthalmic gel formulation of lotilaner designed for application across the eyelid and surrounding tissue that represents a potentially category-creating therapy in an area of high unmet need.\nPrevious clinical trials of lotilaner in DB, MGD, and papulopustular rosacea demonstrated statistically significant improvements in key objective endpoint measures of disease.\nPatent exclusivity expected to extend through 2038.\nBased on FDA feedback, the Company has established a clear regulatory path forward for TP-04 and plans to initiate a Phase 2 study in the second half of 2025. Results are anticipated in 2026.\nAdditional Potential Growth Drivers in 2025 and Beyond\nOn-track for potential European regulatory approval of a preservative-free formulation of XDEMVY in 2027.\nIn Japan, the Company expects to share results from an ongoing DB prevalence study in 2025 and meet with Japanese regulatory authorities to help determine a regulatory path forward.\nThe Chinese regulatory agency, National Medical Products Administration, accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) submitted by Tarsus’s partner, Grand Pharmaceutical Group Ltd., for TP-03 for DB. A decision is anticipated in 2027.\nThe Company remains on-track to provide an update on TP-05 for the potential prevention of Lyme Disease by the FY 2024 earnings call.\nConference Call and Webcast\nTarsus will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, January 14, 2025, at 8:00 a.m. P.T. / 11:00 a.m. E.T. A live webcast will be available on the\nevents\nsection of the Tarsus website. A recorded version of the call will be available on the website shortly after the completion of the call and will be archived there for at least 90 days.\nAbout XDEMVY\n®\nXDEMVY (lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25%), formerly known as TP-03, is a novel prescription eye drop designed to treat\nDemodex\nblepharitis by targeting and eradicating the root cause of the disease –\nDemodex\nmite infestation. XDEMVY was evaluated in two pivotal trials collectively involving more than 800 patients. Both trials met the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints, with statistical significance and no serious treatment-related adverse events. Most patients found the XDEMVY eye drop to be neutral to very comfortable. The most common ocular adverse reactions observed in the studies were instillation site stinging and burning which was reported in 10% of patients. Other ocular adverse reactions reported by less than 2% of patients were chalazion/hordeolum (stye) and punctate keratitis.\nXDEMVY Indication and Important Safety Information\nINDICATIONS AND USAGE\nXDEMVY is indicated for the treatment of\nDemodex\nblepharitis.\nMost common side effects\n: The most common side effect in clinical trials was stinging and burning in 10% of patients. Other side effects in less than 2% of patients were chalazion/hordeolum and punctate keratitis.\nFor additional information, please see full prescribing information available at:\nhttps://xdemvy.com/\n.\nAbout TP-04\nTP-04 is an investigational aqueous gel formulation of lotilaner, a well-characterized anti-parasitic agent that paralyzes and kills mites by selectively inhibiting parasite-specific GABA-Cl channels. Tarsus is studying TP-04 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea (OR).\nAbout TP-05\nTP-05 is an investigational oral systemic formulation of lotilaner, a well-characterized anti-parasitic agent that selectively inhibits parasite-specific GABA-Cl channels. TP-05 is believed to be the only non-vaccine, drug-based, preventative therapeutic in development designed to kill ticks to potentially prevent Lyme disease transmission.\nAbout Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nTarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. applies proven science and new technology to revolutionize treatment for patients, starting with eye care. Tarsus is advancing its pipeline to address several diseases with high unmet need across a range of therapeutic categories, including eye care and infectious disease prevention.

(NASDAQ: MDGL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of resmetirom (Rezdiffra) for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis. The European Commission decision is anticipated in August.\nBill Sibold, Chief Executive Officer of Madrigal, stated, “Madrigal is singularly focused on leading the fight against MASH globally. Resmetirom was the first medication to achieve fibrosis improvement and MASH resolution in a Phase 3 trial, the first medication to receive FDA-approval for MASH, and today’s positive CHMP opinion represents another historic first for the global MASH community. MASH is the fastest-growing indication for liver transplantation in Europe, and we believe resmetirom has the potential to address the urgent unmet need for a foundational, liver-directed therapy to treat patients with this serious disease.”\nMASH is a leading cause of liver-related mortality and an increasing burden on healthcare systems globally. Resmetirom is a once-daily, oral, liver-directed THR-β agonist designed to target key underlying causes of MASH. The CHMP opinion was based on resmetirom’s favorable profile including the positive results from the pivotal Phase 3\nMAESTRO-NASH trial\n, which achieved both fibrosis reduction and MASH resolution primary endpoints.\nJörn M. Schattenberg, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Director of the Department of Medicine at the University Medical Center Homburg and University of the Saarland in Germany, stated, “I’m encouraged by the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending approval of resmetirom. After years of clinical research and growing appreciation of the burden of MASH on patients and health systems across Europe, we are finally on the cusp of having an approved therapy that targets the underlying disease. Importantly, resmetirom is already included in\nEuropean clinical practice guidelines\n, which provide a framework for identifying and monitoring patients with noninvasive tests. If approved, I believe the medication has the potential to transform care for my patients with MASH.”\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval in March 2024 for Rezdiffra in conjunction with diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in ongoing confirmatory trials.\nAbout MASH\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a serious liver disease that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer, need for liver transplantation, and premature mortality. MASH is the leading cause of liver transplantation in women and the second leading cause of all liver transplantation in the U.S., and the fastest-growing indication for liver transplantation in Europe.\nOnce patients progress to MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis), the risk of adverse liver outcomes increases dramatically: these patients have a 10-17 times higher risk of liver-related mortality as compared to patients without fibrosis. Those who progress to cirrhosis face a 42 times higher risk of liver-related mortality, underscoring the need to treat MASH before complications of cirrhosis develop. MASH is also an independent driver of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality for patients.\nAs MASH disease awareness improves and disease prevalence increases, the number of diagnosed patients with MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis or compensated MASH cirrhosis (F2-F4c) is expected to grow.\nAbout Rezdiffra\nRezdiffra is a once-daily, oral, liver-directed THR-β agonist designed to target key underlying causes of MASH. It is the first approved medication for the treatment of MASH in the U.S. In the pivotal Phase 3\nMAESTRO-NASH biopsy trial\n, Rezdiffra achieved both fibrosis improvement and MASH resolution primary endpoints, and 91% of patients treated with Rezdiffra 100 mg experienced improvement or stabilization of liver stiffness. In the U.S., Rezdiffra is indicated in conjunction with diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in ongoing confirmatory trials.\nRezdiffra is not approved in Europe for the treatment of patients with MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis and not approved in any geography for the treatment of patients with cirrhosis. The ongoing, fully enrolled MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial is evaluating progression to liver decompensation events in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis treated with Rezdiffra versus placebo.\nWhat is Rezdiffra?\nRezdiffra is a prescribed medicine used along with diet and exercise to treat adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.\nIt is not known if Rezdiffra is safe and effective in children (under 18 years old).\nThis indication is approved based on improvement of NASH and liver scarring (fibrosis). There are ongoing studies to confirm the clinical benefit of Rezdiffra.\nBefore you take Rezdiffra, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:\nhave any liver problems other than NASH.\nhave gallbladder problems or have been told you have gallbladder problems, including gallstones.\nare pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if Rezdiffra will harm your unborn baby.\nare breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if Rezdiffra passes into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you take Rezdiffra.\nTell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,\nincluding prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.\nRezdiffra and other medicines may affect each other, causing side effects. Rezdiffra may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how Rezdiffra works.\nEspecially tell your healthcare provider if you take medicines that contain gemfibrozil to help lower your triglycerides, or cyclosporine to suppress your immune system, because Rezdiffra is not recommended in patients taking these medicines.\nTell your healthcare provider if you are taking medicines such as clopidogrel to thin your blood or statin medicines to help lower your cholesterol.\nKnow the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.\nWhat are the possible side effects of Rezdiffra?\nRezdiffra may cause serious side effects, including:\nliver injury (hepatotoxicity). Stop taking Rezdiffra and call your healthcare provider right away if you develop the following signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity: tiredness, nausea, vomiting, fever, rash, your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow (jaundice), pain or tenderness in the upper middle or upper right area of your stomach (abdomen).\ngallbladder problems. Gallbladder problems such as gallstones, inflammation of the gallbladder, or inflammation of the pancreas from gallstones can occur with NASH and may occur if you take Rezdiffra. Call your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of these conditions including nausea, vomiting, fever, or pain in your stomach area (abdomen) that is severe and will not go away. The pain may be felt going from your abdomen to your back and the pain may happen with or without vomiting.\nThe most common side effects of Rezdiffra include:\ndiarrhea, nausea, itching, stomach (abdominal) pain, vomiting, dizziness, constipation. These are not all the possible side effects of Rezdiffra. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.\nCall your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or\nwww.fda.gov/medwatch\n.

(NASDAQ: MDGL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), today announced positive two-year results from the open-label compensated MASH cirrhosis (F4c) arm of the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial of Rezdiffra. Patients (n=122) in the study achieved significant improvements from baseline in liver stiffness, liver fat, fibrosis biomarkers, liver volume and risk scores for clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH).\n“Rezdiffra demonstrated broad, sustained efficacy across multiple noninvasive parameters at two years of treatment. A high, statistically significant percentage of patients with CSPH or probable CSPH at baseline shifted to lower risk categories,” said Naim Alkhouri, M.D., Chief Academic Officer at Summit Clinical Research and the Director of the Steatotic Liver Disease Program at the Clinical Research Institute of Ohio. “A larger placebo-controlled study will be needed to confirm Rezdiffra’s benefit in F4c, but the totality of data in this high-risk population of patients on the cusp of progressing to liver decompensation is highly encouraging as we await results from the ongoing Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial of Rezdiffra.”\nCSPH is a major consequence of cirrhosis and is responsible for its most severe complications, including ascites, variceal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy. Patients with MASH who progress to cirrhosis face a 42 times higher risk of liver-related mortality.\nMAESTRO-NAFLD-1 included an open-label active treatment arm of patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis. After one year, patients were given the option to enroll in an open-label extension trial; 122 patients enrolled and 113 completed two years of treatment. At baseline, 35% of patients met Baveno criteria for CSPH, 14% for probable CSPH and 51% for no/low CSPH. The Baveno criteria use a combination of vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and platelet count to assess CSPH risk.\nAmong patients with CSPH at baseline, 65% moved into lower risk categories by year two (42% to no/low CSPH and 23% to probable CSPH). Among patients with probable CSPH at baseline, 57% moved into the no/low CSPH category as compared to 14% who moved into the CSPH category by year two. Improvement in CSPH risk was statistically significant compared to baseline. Similar shifts to lower risk categories were observed in an analysis using a more stringent modified Baveno criteria that incorporates magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test as additional evidence for CSPH risk.\nAs previously reported, patients achieved a mean 6.7 kPa reduction in liver stiffness at two years, which was statistically significant compared to baseline. In a responder analysis examining ≥25% improvement or worsening of liver stiffness, 51% of patients achieved improvement. An improvement of this magnitude has been associated with reduced progression to end-stage liver disease.\n1\nRezdiffra helped 35% of patients achieve liver stiffness measurements consistent with F3 fibrosis, suggesting reversal of cirrhosis.\nSafety data were consistent with previous studies and Rezdiffra was well-tolerated with a low rate of discontinuation due to adverse events. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, COVID-19 and nausea. There were two deaths unrelated to Rezdiffra.\n“Lower thyroid-hormone receptor-beta (THR-β) activity in the liver is predictive of hepatic decompensation\n2\nin patients with MASH, so there is a strong mechanistic rationale supporting the potential of Rezdiffra, a THR-β agonist, to improve outcomes in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis,” said David Soergel, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Madrigal. “These two-year open-label data from MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 add important clinical evidence that supports our confidence in the ongoing, fully enrolled Phase 3 outcomes trial of Rezdiffra in compensated MASH cirrhosis.”\nInvestor Webcast to Review New F4c Data\nAt 8 a.m. EDT May 13, 2025, Madrigal will host a webcast to review the detailed two-year data from the compensated MASH cirrhosis (F4c) arm of the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial. To access the webcast, please visit the investor relations section of the Madrigal website or\nclick here\nto register.\nAbout MASH\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a serious liver disease that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer, need for liver transplantation, and premature mortality. MASH is expected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the U.S. and is already the leading cause of liver transplantation among women.\nOnce patients progress to MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis), the risk of adverse liver outcomes increases dramatically: these patients have a 10-17 times higher risk of liver-related mortality as compared to patients without fibrosis. Those who progress to cirrhosis face a 42 times higher risk of liver-related mortality, underscoring the need to treat MASH before complications of cirrhosis develop. MASH is also an independent driver of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality for patients.\nAn estimated 1.5 million patients have been diagnosed with MASH in the U.S., and Madrigal is focused on reaching approximately 315,000 patients with moderate to advanced fibrosis who are under the care of liver specialists. As MASH disease awareness improves and disease prevalence increases, the number of diagnosed patients with MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis is expected to grow.\nAbout Rezdiffra\nRezdiffra is a once-daily, oral, liver-directed THR-β agonist designed to target key underlying causes of MASH. It is the first approved medication for the treatment of MASH in the U.S. In the pivotal Phase 3\nMAESTRO-NASH biopsy trial\n, Rezdiffra achieved both fibrosis improvement and MASH resolution primary endpoints, and 91% of patients treated with Rezdiffra 100 mg experienced improvement or stabilization of liver stiffness. In the U.S., Rezdiffra is indicated in conjunction with diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in ongoing confirmatory trials.\nRezdiffra is not approved in Europe for the treatment of patients with MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis and not approved in any geography for the treatment of patients with cirrhosis. The ongoing, fully enrolled MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial is evaluating progression to liver decompensation events in patients with compensated NASH cirrhosis treated with Rezdiffra versus placebo. A positive outcome is expected to support the full approval of Rezdiffra for noncirrhotic MASH and expand the eligible patient population for Rezdiffra with an additional indication in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis.\nWhat is Rezdiffra?\nRezdiffra is a prescribed medicine used along with diet and exercise to treat adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.\nIt is not known if Rezdiffra is safe and effective in children (under 18 years old).\nThis indication is approved based on improvement of NASH and liver scarring (fibrosis). There are ongoing studies to confirm the clinical benefit of Rezdiffra.\nBefore you take Rezdiffra, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:\nhave any liver problems other than NASH.\nhave gallbladder problems or have been told you have gallbladder problems, including gallstones.\nare pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if Rezdiffra will harm your unborn baby.\nare breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if Rezdiffra passes into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you take Rezdiffra.\nTell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,\nincluding prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.\nRezdiffra and other medicines may affect each other, causing side effects. Rezdiffra may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how Rezdiffra works.\nEspecially tell your healthcare provider if you take medicines that contain gemfibrozil to help lower your triglycerides, or cyclosporine to suppress your immune system, because Rezdiffra is not recommended in patients taking these medicines.\nTell your healthcare provider if you are taking medicines such as clopidogrel to thin your blood or statin medicines to help lower your cholesterol.\nKnow the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.\nWhat are the possible side effects of Rezdiffra?\nRezdiffra may cause serious side effects, including:\nliver injury (hepatotoxicity).

(NASDAQ: MDGL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), today reports first-quarter 2025 financial results and provides corporate updates.\nBill Sibold, Chief Executive Officer of Madrigal, stated, “Since Rezdiffra’s approval last year, we’ve executed an exceptional launch. We introduced the first FDA-approved treatment for MASH, launched with a best-case label, built a strong foundation with healthcare providers and payers, and delivered Rezdiffra to more than 17,000 patients. What’s most gratifying is the positive feedback we’re hearing from healthcare providers – they’re seeing meaningful improvements in the measures that matter most to patients, including liver stiffness, liver fat, liver enzymes, LDL and triglycerides, which are exceeding their expectations.”\nSibold continued, “We’re building on our leadership in MASH, and we believe Rezdiffra is on track to become the foundational therapy across F2 to F4c MASH. Later this month at the EASL Congress, we’ll share new Rezdiffra F4c late-breaking data from our MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial that shows its effect on the risk of clinically significant portal hypertension – a major consequence of cirrhosis that’s responsible for its most severe complications. In addition, we’re awaiting a regulatory decision from the European Medicines Agency expected mid-year that, if positive, would make Rezdiffra the first MASH therapy approved for patients in Europe.”\nFirst Quarter 2025 and Recent Corporate Updates\nMarked the one-year approval anniversary of Rezdiffra on March 14, 2024; more than 17,000 patients on Rezdiffra as of March 31, 2025\nReported two-year F4c data from MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial\nIn February, Madrigal announced two-year results from the active-treatment open-label compensated MASH cirrhosis (F4c) arm of its Phase 3 MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial (n=101):\nPatients achieved a mean 6.7 kPa reduction in liver stiffness as measured by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE). This reduction was statistically significant as compared to baseline.\n51% of patients achieved a ≥ 25% reduction in liver stiffness as measured by VCTE. A reduction of this magnitude has been associated with reduced progression to end-stage liver disease.\nRezdiffra’s safety and tolerability profile was consistent with other Rezdiffra clinical trials with a low discontinuation rate due to adverse events.\nThe results further support the potential benefit of Rezdiffra in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis and the potential success of the ongoing MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial, a double blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial in F4c, for which data are anticipated in 2027.\nStrong presence at upcoming European Association for the Study of Liver (EASL) Congress being held May 7-10, 2025\nSix Madrigal abstracts were accepted by the EASL Congress, which will take place from May 7-10, 2025, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The abstracts include a late-breaking oral presentation with detailed two-year data from the active-treatment open-label compensated MASH cirrhosis (F4c) arm of the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial. The presentation will focus on the impact of Rezdiffra on liver stiffness, fibrosis biomarkers and the risk of clinically significant portal hypertension, a major consequence of cirrhosis that’s responsible for its most severe complications, such as ascites, variceal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy.\nMadrigal will host an investor webcast to review the F4c two-year data on May 13, 2025\nAt 8 a.m. EDT May 13, 2025, Madrigal will host a webcast to review the detailed two-year data from the active-treatment open-label compensated MASH cirrhosis (F4c) arm of the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial.

No product sales were recognized during the comparable prior year period.\nOperating Expenses:\nFirst-quarter 2025 operating expenses were $216.6 million, compared to $152.0 million in the comparable prior year period.\nCost of sales:\nFirst-quarter 2025 cost of sales was $4.5 million. Cost of sales was not recognized during the comparable prior year period given that no product sales were recorded.\nR&D Expense:\nFirst-quarter 2025 R&D expense was $44.2 million, compared to $71.2 million in the comparable prior year period. Research and development expenses decreased by $27.1 million primarily due the change in accounting for inventory costs following FDA approval of Rezdiffra in March 2024 and a reduction in clinical trial expense.\nSG&A Expense:\nFirst-quarter 2025 SG&A expense was $167.9 million compared to $80.8 million in the comparable prior year period. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $87.1 million due primarily to increases for commercial launch activities for Rezdiffra, including a corresponding increase in headcount, and an increase in stock compensation expense.\nInterest Income:\nFirst-quarter 2025 interest income was $9.4 million compared to $8.3 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in interest income was due primarily to higher principal balances.\nInterest Expense:\nFirst-quarter 2025 interest expense was $3.3 million compared to $3.8 million in the comparable prior year period. The decrease of $0.5 million was primarily the result of lower interest rates in 2025.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Marketable Securities:\nAs of March 31, 2025, Madrigal had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities of $848.1 million, compared to $931.3 million at December 31, 2024.

An archived webcast will be available on the Madrigal website following the event.\nAbout MASH\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a serious liver disease that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer, need for liver transplantation, and premature mortality. MASH is expected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the U.S. and is already the leading cause of liver transplantation among women.\nOnce patients progress to MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis), the risk of adverse liver outcomes increases dramatically. These patients have a 10 to 17 times higher risk of liver-related mortality as compared to patients without fibrosis. Those who progress to cirrhosis face a 42 times higher risk of liver-related mortality, underscoring the need to treat MASH before complications of cirrhosis develop. MASH is also an independent driver of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality for patients.\nAn estimated 1.5 million patients have been diagnosed with MASH in the U.S., and Madrigal is focused on reaching approximately 315,000 patients with moderate to advanced fibrosis who are under the care of liver specialists. As MASH disease awareness improves and disease prevalence increases, the number of diagnosed patients with MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis is expected to grow.\nAbout Rezdiffra\nWhat is Rezdiffra?\nRezdiffra is a prescribed medicine used along with diet and exercise to treat adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.\nIt is not known if Rezdiffra is safe and effective in children (under 18 years old).\nThis indication is approved based on improvement of NASH and liver scarring (fibrosis).

(NASDAQ: MDGL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), today announced six presentations at the upcoming European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Congress, taking place from May 7-10, 2025, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Madrigal will share detailed two-year data from the open-label compensated MASH cirrhosis (F4c) arm of the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial in a late-breaking oral presentation titled, “Treatment with resmetirom for up to two years led to improvement in liver stiffness, fibrosis biomarkers, fibrosis scores and portal hypertension risk in 122 patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis.”\n“Patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis who develop clinically significant portal hypertension are at greatly elevated risk of experiencing life-threatening complications of late-stage liver disease so there is an urgent need to advance new treatment strategies for this vulnerable population,” said Bill Sibold, Chief Executive Officer of Madrigal. “The late-breaking data we will be presenting at EASL suggest that resmetirom may help halt or reverse disease progression in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis, and we look forward to sharing important new findings examining the medication’s impact on portal hypertension risk. These data reinforce our conviction in resmetirom’s potential to become the foundational therapy across F2 to F4c MASH.”\n“This EASL Congress comes at an ideal time for our growing team in Europe,” added Neil Archer, Executive Vice President and Head of International for Madrigal. “As we prepare for a European Commission decision on our marketing authorization application for resmetirom, EASL will provide a valuable opportunity to listen, learn and engage with healthcare providers, patient advocates and other stakeholders who are working to improve care for this serious disease.”\nResmetirom is a once-daily, oral, liver-directed thyroid hormone receptor (THR)-β agonist designed to target key underlying causes of MASH. It is the first approved medication for the treatment of MASH in the U.S. In the pivotal Phase 3\nMAESTRO-NASH biopsy trial\n, resmetirom achieved both fibrosis improvement and MASH resolution primary endpoints, and 91% of patients treated with resmetirom 100 mg experienced improvement or stabilization of liver stiffness. In the U.S., resmetirom is indicated in conjunction with diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in ongoing confirmatory trials.\nResmetirom is not approved in Europe for the treatment of patients with MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis and not approved in any geography for the treatment of patients with cirrhosis. A marketing authorization application (MAA) for resmetirom is under evaluation with the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The CHMP opinion and subsequent European Union (EU) decision are expected in mid-2025. Madrigal expects to launch resmetirom in Europe on a country-by-country basis commencing with Germany in the second half of 2025, pending European Commission approval.\nMadrigal Data Presentations at the EASL Congress 2025\nLate-Breaking Oral Presentation: “Treatment with resmetirom for up to two years led to improvement in liver stiffness, fibrosis biomarkers, fibrosis scores and portal hypertension risk in 122 patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis” [Saturday, May 10, at 13:15 CEST.

(NASDAQ: MDGL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), today announced that Rebecca Taub, M.D., the company's founder, Chief Medical Officer, and President of Research & Development (R&D), will transition to the role of Senior Scientific and Medical Advisor. Dr. Taub will continue to serve on Madrigal's Board of Directors. Succeeding her, David Soergel, M.D., has been appointed Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer, effective April 21, 2025.\nAfter teaching Genetics and Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was one of the youngest women at that time to become a fully tenured Professor, Dr. Taub moved into senior R&D leadership roles at Bristol Myers Squibb and Roche. In 2011, she co-founded Madrigal with a vision to address unmet medical needs for patients with serious liver and cardiometabolic diseases. Under her leadership, the company achieved an unprecedented milestone – the development of the first FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of MASH, Rezdiffra™ (resmetirom).\n\"Becky's visionary leadership and relentless commitment have been instrumental in Madrigal's success and the success of the MASH field,\" said Bill Sibold, Chief Executive Officer of Madrigal. \"Her pioneering work as both a scientist and entrepreneur led to the development and approval of Rezdiffra – the first-ever FDA-approved medicine for MASH – bringing real hope to patients who previously had no options. We are incredibly grateful for her contributions and are fortunate to have her continued guidance as a strategic advisor and Madrigal board member. Becky represents the best of what our industry is capable of, and I hope her story will serve as an inspiration for people beginning their careers in biopharma.\"\n“As Becky moves into her new role, we’re thrilled to welcome David Soergel to Madrigal,” said Sibold. “Dave brings more than 20 years of leadership experience in metabolic and cardiovascular disease drug development, spanning both biotech and large pharma. As we look to build a pipeline beyond Rezdiffra, Dave’s deep clinical development expertise and strong track record of advancing therapies across multiple therapeutic areas is exactly the kind of experience that aligns with where we’re taking the company.”\n“I’d like to thank my colleagues, our research partners, and the many patients in the MASH community who have made invaluable contributions to Madrigal’s success,” said Dr. Taub. “What started as a small team of fewer than 10 R&D professionals in Conshohocken, PA is now a commercial-stage biopharma company with more than five hundred employees across the U.S. and Europe. I look forward to supporting Dave in my role as a scientific and medical advisor as Madrigal enters its next phase.”\nDr. Soergel joins Madrigal from Novartis, where he served as the Executive Vice President and Global Head of Cardiovascular, Renal, and Metabolism Development, overseeing 10 late-stage development programs in 2024. At Novartis, Dave led teams that designed and implemented evidence generation programs supporting the expansion of Entresto’s indications and uses. Additionally, he advanced novel medicines to approval for cardiovascular and renal diseases, including Leqvio, Fabhalta and Vanrafia, and served as the development lead for the acquisitions of the Medicines Company and Chinook Therapeutics. Prior to Novartis, Dr. Soergel held leadership roles at biotechnology companies, including Senior Vice President of Clinical Development and Chief Medical Officer at Trevena, where he was responsible for the development of novel treatments for pain and other conditions. He began his career in early-stage clinical development and translational medicine at GlaxoSmithKline. Dr. Soergel trained in pediatrics, pediatric cardiology, and heart failure and transplant at Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n“It is a great privilege to be succeeding Becky as Chief Medical Officer and I look forward to tapping into her expertise and guidance as I begin my new role at Madrigal,” said Dr. Soergel. “I’m excited to be joining an R&D team that delivered the first approved therapy in a disease that has been a major challenge for drug development. With two fully enrolled outcomes studies of Rezdiffra underway, Madrigal is at the forefront of scientific innovation in MASH, and the company is well-positioned to build on its leadership position through pipeline expansion.”\nAbout Madrigal Pharmaceuticals\nMadrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MDGL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), today reports fourth-quarter and year-end 2024 financial results and reviews business highlights.\nBill Sibold, Chief Executive Officer of Madrigal, stated, “Looking back on 2024, I’m incredibly proud of what we accomplished. We secured FDA approval for Rezdiffra, the first medicine approved for MASH, in March; executed a first-in-disease launch with remarkable results; and are well positioned for strong performance again in 2025 and beyond.”\nSibold continued, “The U.S. launch of Rezdiffra has energized the MASH community, and we’re positioned to extend our leadership. Today, we’re sharing new two-year analyses from an active-treatment open-label extension arm of our Phase 3 MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial that demonstrate Rezdiffra continues to improve key markers of MASH fibrosis out to two years in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis (F4c). These results add to the growing body of evidence supporting Rezdiffra’s potential benefit in this high-risk patient population, for which there is no approved therapy. A positive read out in our fully enrolled Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial could make Rezdiffra the first and only treatment for F2 to F4c MASH, and the only therapy with outcomes data this decade.”\nNew Two-Year Data from the Active-Treatment Open-Label Compensated MASH Cirrhosis Arm of the Rezdiffra Phase 3 MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 Trial\nMAESTRO-NAFLD-1 was a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 3 safety trial conducted to support regulatory approval of Rezdiffra. The trial includes an active-treatment open-label extension arm in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis. Madrigal previously reported one-year results for this active treatment arm.\nToday, the Company is announcing, two-year results (n=101):\nThe patient cohort achieved a mean 6.7 kPa reduction in liver stiffness as measured by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE); this represents the largest VCTE reduction reported in an F4c MASH patient population to date. This reduction was statistically significant as compared to baseline.\n51% of patients achieved a ≥ 25% reduction in liver stiffness as measured by VCTE. A reduction of this magnitude has been associated with reduced progression to end-stage liver disease.\nRezdiffra’s safety and tolerability profile was consistent with other Rezdiffra clinical trials with a low discontinuation rate due to adverse events.\nMadrigal plans to present these data and additional findings from the active-treatment open-label cirrhosis arm of the MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial at a future medical meeting.\nThe results further support the potential benefit of Rezdiffra in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis and the potential success of the ongoing MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial, a double blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial in F4c, for which data are anticipated in 2027.\n2024 Highlights\nLandmark FDA approval of Rezdiffra\nIn February 2024, Rezdiffra Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH trial 52-week results were published in\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\n; the paper was subsequently chosen as one of the journal’s 14 notable scientific research articles of 2024.\nIn March 2024, Madrigal announced FDA approval of Rezdiffra for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis).\nIn April 2024, Rezdiffra became commercially available as the first and only approved therapy for MASH.\nExpert guidelines recommend Rezdiffra as first-line therapy for MASH\nIn June 2024, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Congress updated their practice guidelines to recommend Rezdiffra as a first-line therapy for MASH, subject to regulatory approval in Europe.\nIn October 2024, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), a leading organization of scientists and health care professionals committed to preventing and curing liver disease, updated their practice guidelines to recommend Rezdiffra as a first-line therapy for MASH and implemented recommendations regarding its use for clinicians.\nDriving future growth through European expansion\nIn March 2024, Madrigal announced that the marketing authorization application (MAA) for resmetirom for the treatment of MASH with liver fibrosis was validated and is under evaluation with the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The CHMP opinion and subsequent European Union (EU) decision is expected in mid-2025.\nMadrigal expects to launch Rezdiffra in Europe on a country-by-country basis commencing with Germany in the second half of 2025, pending EMA approval, which would make it the first approved therapy for patients with MASH liver fibrosis in Europe.\nDriving future growth through indication expansion\nIn October 2024, Madrigal announced completion of enrollment in the MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial, an event-driven trial evaluating Rezdiffra in patients with F4c, an advanced and underserved patient population. Positive results could position Rezdiffra to become the only treatment for F2 to F4c MASH and the only therapy with outcomes data in MASH this decade.\nStrong presence at key liver meetings\nIn June 2024, Madrigal presented 10 abstracts at the EASL congress, including noninvasive test (NIT) data that demonstrated 91% of patients achieved improvement or stabilization of liver stiffness out to three years.\nIn November 2024, Madrigal had a significant presence at the AASLD Liver Meeting. Eleven Madrigal abstracts were presented at the meeting, including two oral presentations of new analyses from the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH trial of Rezdiffra.\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Financial Results\nTotal revenues:\nThe Company generated fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 net revenues of $103.3 million and $180.1 million, respectively. No product sales were recognized during the comparable prior year period.\nOperating Expenses:\nFourth-quarter and full-year 2024 operating expenses were $170.3 million and $678.0 million, respectively, compared to $117.2 million and $380.5 million in the comparable prior year periods.\nCost of sales:\nFourth-quarter and full-year 2024 cost of sales were $3.4 million and $6.2 million, respectively. Cost of sales were not recognized during the comparable prior year periods given that no product sales were recorded.\nR&D Expense:\nFourth-quarter and full-year 2024 R&D expense was $25.6 million and $236.7 million, respectively, compared to $70.6 million and $272.4 million in the comparable prior year periods. Research and development expenses decreased by $35.6 million in 2024 due primarily to a reduction in clinical trial accruals and the change in accounting for inventory costs following FDA approval of Rezdiffra in March 2024, partially offset by increases in headcount.\nSG&A Expense:\nFourth-quarter and full-year 2024 SG&A expense was $141.2 million and $435.1 million, respectively, compared to $46.5 million and $108.1 million in the comparable prior year periods. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $326.9 million in 2024 due primarily to increases for commercial launch activities for Rezdiffra, including a corresponding increase in headcount, and an increase in stock compensation expense.\nInterest Income:\nFourth-quarter and full-year 2024 interest income was $11.1 million and $46.7 million, respectively, compared to $9.0 million and $19.6 million in the comparable prior year periods. The increase in interest income was due primarily to higher principal balances and interest rates in 2024.\nInterest Expense:\nFourth-quarter and full-year 2024 interest expense was $3.5 million and $14.7 million, respectively, compared to $4.0 million and $12.7 million in the comparable prior year periods. The increase in interest expense in 2024 was primarily the result of a higher average outstanding principal balance during the period under the Madrigal’s loan facility.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Marketable Securities:\nAs of December 31, 2024, Madrigal had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities of $931.3 million, compared to $634.1 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to the $659.9 million of net proceeds we received from our underwritten public offering in March 2024.\nConference Call and Webcast\nAt 8 a.m. EST today, February 26, 2025, Madrigal will host a webcast to review its financial and operating results and provide a general business update.

An archived webcast will be available on the Madrigal website following the event.\nAbout MASH\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a serious liver disease that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer, need for liver transplantation, and premature mortality. MASH is expected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the U.S. and is already the leading cause of liver transplantation among women.\nOnce patients progress to MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis), the risk of adverse liver outcomes increases dramatically: these patients have a 10-17 times higher risk of liver-related mortality as compared to patients without fibrosis. Those who progress to cirrhosis face a 42 times higher risk of liver-related mortality, underscoring the need to treat MASH before complications of cirrhosis develop. MASH is also an independent driver of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality for patients.\nAn estimated 1.5 million patients have been diagnosed with MASH in the U.S., and Madrigal is focused on reaching approximately 315,000 patients with moderate to advanced fibrosis who are under the care of liver specialists. As MASH disease awareness improves and disease prevalence increases, the number of diagnosed patients with MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis is expected to grow.\nAbout Rezdiffra\nWhat is Rezdiffra?\nRezdiffra is a prescribed medicine used along with diet and exercise to treat adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.\nIt is not known if Rezdiffra is safe and effective in children (under 18 years old).\nThis indication is approved based on improvement of NASH and liver scarring (fibrosis). There are ongoing studies to confirm the clinical benefit of Rezdiffra.\nBefore you take Rezdiffra, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:\nhave any liver problems other than NASH.\nhave gallbladder problems or have been told you have gallbladder problems, including gallstones.\nare pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if Rezdiffra will harm your unborn baby.\nare breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if Rezdiffra passes into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you take Rezdiffra.\nTell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,\nincluding prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.\nRezdiffra and other medicines may affect each other, causing side effects.

(NASDAQ:MDGL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), today reported positive two-year results from the open-label compensated MASH cirrhosis (F4c) arm of the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial of Rezdiffra (resmetirom). Patients treated with Rezdiffra achieved marked reductions in liver stiffness, a surrogate for fibrosis, measured by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE).\nThe Phase 3 MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial of Rezdiffra included an open-label active treatment arm of patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis. Madrigal previously reported one-year results from this cohort. Following two years of treatment, 101 patients had VCTE results for analysis. Mean liver stiffness at baseline was 25 kPa and patients achieved a mean 6.7 kPa reduction in liver stiffness at two years (6.1 kPa at one year), which was statistically significant compared to baseline. This represents the largest reduction in liver stiffness reported to date in an F4c MASH population.\nMazen Noureddin, M.D., M.H.Sc., Professor of Medicine, Director Houston Research Institute and C.S.O. Summit Clinical Research, stated, “These data demonstrating patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis achieved marked reductions in VCTE are highly encouraging. We use the ‘Baveno rule of 5 kPa’ to stratify risk of liver-related events in patients with MASH, so a mean 6.7 kPa reduction suggests that many patients are moving into a lower risk category. The results are particularly meaningful in light of recently published, multi-center, longitudinal studies\n1,2\ndemonstrating VCTE is a strong predictor of clinical outcomes and may be more predictive of clinical outcomes than fibrosis stage assessed by liver biopsy.”\nIn a responder analysis examining ≥25% improvement or worsening of liver stiffness, 51% of patients achieved improvement. An improvement of this magnitude has been associated with reduced progression to end-stage liver disease.\n1\nThe safety and tolerability profile of Rezdiffra in the compensated MASH cohort of MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 was consistent with other Rezdiffra clinical trials, with a low rate of discontinuations due to adverse events.\nBecky Taub, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and President of Research & Development of Madrigal, stated, “Patients with MASH who progress to cirrhosis face a 42 times higher risk of liver-related mortality, so there is an urgent need to improve care for this underserved population with no approved treatment options. The new two-year data from MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 reinforce our confidence in the ongoing, fully enrolled MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial of Rezdiffra in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis. If our OUTCOMES trial is successful, Rezdiffra has the potential to become the first therapy for F2-F4c MASH. It is important to remember that Rezdiffra should not be used for the treatment of patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis until safety and efficacy are established in our Phase 3 trial and the medication receives approval for this indication from regulatory authorities.”\nDraft FDA guidance recommends that Phase 3 clinical trials in MASH cirrhosis use outcomes as an endpoint, as opposed to biopsy-based surrogate endpoints. This guidance, along with data from the open-label compensated MASH cirrhosis arm of MAESTRO-NAFLD-1, informed the design of the ongoing Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial.\nMadrigal plans to present additional results from the compensated MASH cirrhosis arm of the MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial at a future medical conference.\nRezdiffra is indicated in conjunction with diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in ongoing confirmatory trials. Rezdiffra is not approved for the treatment of patients with MASH cirrhosis.\nAbout MASH\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a serious liver disease that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer, need for liver transplantation, and premature mortality.

The primary results of the MAESTRO-NASH trial were published in the\nNew England Journal of Medicine\nin February 2024.\nMAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES (Compensated Cirrhosis)\nevaluates progression to liver decompensation events in patients with compensated NASH cirrhosis treated with Rezdiffra versus placebo. A positive outcome is expected to support the full approval of Rezdiffra for noncirrhotic MASH and expand the eligible patient population for Rezdiffra with an additional indication in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis.\nThe\nMAESTRO-NAFLD-1 (Safety)\ntrial was designed to noninvasively evaluate the safety and tolerability of Rezdiffra and provide a larger safety database to support regulatory benefit-risk assessment. The primary results from the MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial were published in\nNature Medicine\nin October 2023. MAESTRO-NAFLD-OLE, an open-label active treatment extension of MAESTRO-NAFLD-1, is ongoing to collect additional safety data in patients with noncirrhotic NASH and patients with compensated NASH cirrhosis.\nData from the 52-week portion of MAESTRO-NASH, together with data from MAESTRO-NAFLD-1, MAESTRO-NAFLD-OLE, Phase 2 and Phase 1 data, including safety parameters, formed the basis for accelerated approval of Rezdiffra for treatment of MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis.\nAbout Madrigal\nMadrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MDGL) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a liver disease with high unmet medical need.

(NASDAQ:MDGL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), today announced an update on its business performance, including preliminary* fourth-quarter and year-end net sales, year-end cash and patients on Rezdiffra.\nBill Sibold, Chief Executive Officer of Madrigal, stated, “2024 was a transformational year for Madrigal and the MASH field. Rezdiffra received U.S. FDA approval as the first and only treatment for MASH; we built an expert team for launch; and now more than 11,800 patients are on therapy. Our success reflects exceptional execution and the urgent need for treatments for this serious liver disease, expected to become the leading cause of liver transplants in the U.S.”\nSibold continued, “As we build momentum in the U.S., we are pursuing additional growth opportunities, including preparing for European expansion in the second half of 2025. Looking ahead, the MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial in compensated cirrhosis could unlock further growth, positioning Rezdiffra as the only treatment for F2 to F4 MASH and the only therapy with outcomes data this decade.”\nPreliminary Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Financial Performance and Rezdiffra Patients\nPreliminary fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 Rezdiffra net sales ranges of $100 million to $103 million and $177 million to $180 million, respectively.\nPreliminary year-end 2024 cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities of approximately $931 million.\nMore than 11,800 patients on Rezdifrra as of year-end 2024.\n2024 Accomplishments\nOn February 8, the Rezdiffra Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH trial results were published in\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\n; the paper was subsequently chosen as one of the journal’s 14 notable scientific research articles of 2024.\nOn March 5, announced EMA validation of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Rezdiffra; Company anticipates EMA decision mid-2025 with a country-by-country launch in Europe expected to commence with Germany in second-half 2025, subject to EMA approval.\nOn March 14, received U.S. FDA approval for Rezdiffra, the first and only approved MASH therapy, and subsequently launched the medicine.\nOn October 21, announced completion of enrollment in the MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES study, an event-driven trial evaluating Rezdiffra in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis. Positive results could position Rezdiffra to become the first treatment available for this advanced and underserved population.\nJ.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference Presentation and Webcast\nBill Sibold, Chief Executive Officer of Madrigal, will discuss these updates as part of a webcast presentation at the 43\nrd\nannual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, January 15 at 2:15 p.m. PST (5:15 p.m. EST). The event will be available via live webcast on Madrigal’s Investor Relations page [\nLINK HERE\n].\nAbout MASH\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a serious liver disease that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer, need for liver transplantation, and premature mortality. MASH is expected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the U.S. and is already the leading cause of liver transplantation among women.\nOnce patients progress to MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis), the risk of adverse liver outcomes increases dramatically: these patients have a 10-17 times higher risk of liver-related mortality as compared to patients without fibrosis. Those who progress to cirrhosis face a 42 times higher risk of liver-related mortality, underscoring the need to treat MASH before complications of cirrhosis develop. MASH is also an independent driver of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality for patients.\nAn estimated 1.5 million patients have been diagnosed with MASH in the U.S., and Madrigal is focused on reaching approximately 315,000 patients with moderate to advanced fibrosis who are under the care of liver specialists. As MASH disease awareness improves and disease prevalence increases, the number of diagnosed patients with MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis is expected to grow.\nAbout Madrigal\nMadrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MDGL) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a liver disease with high unmet medical need. Madrigal’s medication, Rezdiffra (resmetirom), is a once-daily, oral, liver-directed THR-β agonist designed to target key underlying causes of MASH.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements; the finalization and audit of Madrigal’s fourth quarter and 2024 fiscal year financial results which could potentially result in changes or adjustments to the selected preliminary financial results presented herein; risks of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals, including, but not limited to, potential regulatory delays or rejections; the challenges with the commercial launch of a new product, particularly for a company that does not have commercial experience; our history of operating losses and the possibility that we may never achieve or maintain profitability; risks associated with meeting the objectives of Madrigal’s clinical studies, including, but not limited to Madrigal’s ability to achieve enrollment objectives concerning patient numbers (including an adequate safety database), outcomes objectives and/or timing objectives for Madrigal’s studies; any delays or failures in enrollment, and the occurrence of adverse safety events; risks related to the effects of Rezdiffra’s (resmetirom’s) mechanism of action; enrollment and trial conclusion uncertainties; market demand for and acceptance of Rezdiffra; the potential inability to raise sufficient capital to fund ongoing operations as currently planned or to obtain financing on acceptable terms; the ability to service indebtedness and otherwise comply with debt covenants; outcomes or trends from competitive studies; future topline data timing or results; our ability to prevent and/or mitigate cyber-attacks; the timing and outcomes of clinical studies of Rezdiffra (resmetirom); the uncertainties inherent in clinical testing; uncertainties concerning analyses or assessments outside of a controlled clinical trial; and changes in laws and regulations applicable to our business and our ability to comply with such laws and regulations. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Madrigal undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or circumstances after the date they are made, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Please refer to Madrigal’s submissions filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for more detailed information regarding these risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Madrigal specifically discusses these risks and uncertainties in greater detail in the sections appearing in Part I, Item 1A of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024, and Part II, Item 1A of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on October 31, 2024, and as updated from time to time by Madrigal’s other filings with the SEC.\n*\nFourth quarter and full-year 2024 financial results are preliminary, unaudited, subject to adjustment, and provided as an approximation in advance of the Company’s announcement of complete financial results in February 2025. This information is based on currently available information. Madrigal has provided estimated ranges primarily because financial closing controls and procedures for the quarter are not yet completed and final results may therefore vary from these estimates. These preliminary estimates have not been audited by Madrigal’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nInvestor Contact\nTina Ventura,\nIR@madrigalpharma.com\nMedia Contact\nChristopher Frates,\nmedia@madrigalpharma.com\nTags\nbiotech\nNASH\nMASH"
